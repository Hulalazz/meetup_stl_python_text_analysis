Founded in 1636, it is one of the oldest cities in the United States. [ 5 ] It is located in Providence County , and is the third-largest city in the New England region after Boston and Worcester . Providence has a city population of 179,154 and is part of the 38th -largest metropolitan population in the country, with an estimated population of 1,604,291, exceeding that of Rhode Island by about 60%, as it extends into southern Massachusetts . [ 6 ] This can be considered in turn to be part of the Greater Boston commuting area, which contains 7.6 million people. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River , at the head of Narragansett Bay . Providence was founded by Roger Williams , a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony . He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence" , which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. After becoming one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its jewelry and silverware industry. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains significant manufacturing activity. Once nicknamed the "Beehive of Industry", Providence began rebranding itself as the "Creative Capital" in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community.

Williams and his company felt compelled to withdraw from Massachusetts Bay Colony . They were greeted by the Narragansetts on rocks near present-day Gano Street with the greeting, "What Cheer, Netop." They sought refuge with the Narragansett tribe at a place on the banks of a salt cove, as the chief of the Narragansett, Canonicus , made them welcome. [ 8 ] In 1636, Canonicus gave Williams the large tract of land which became the first nucleus of the colony of Providence Plantation . Williams' Providence soon became a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as he himself had been exiled from Massachusetts . [ 9 ] Providence's growth would be slow during the next quarter-century—the subsuming of its territory into surrounding towns, difficulty of farming the land, and differing of local traditions and land conflicts all slowed development. [ 9 ] Providence in the mid-nineteenth century Revolution [ edit ] In the mid-1770s, the British government levied taxes that impeded Providence's maritime, fishing and agricultural industries, the mainstay of the city's economy. One example was the Sugar Act , which was a tax levied against Providence's distilleries that adversely affected its trade in rum and slaves . These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown. In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled blood in the leadup to the American Revolution in the notorious Gaspée Affair of 1772. [ 9 ] Though during the American Revolutionary War the city escaped British occupation, the capture of nearby Newport disrupted industry and kept the population on alert. Troops were quartered for various campaigns and Brown University 's University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital. [ 9 ] French troops were quartered in the city's Market House . [ 10 ] After departing from Newport , French troops sent by King Louis XVI and commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau passed through Providence on their way to join the attack against British forces. The march from Newport to Providence was the beginning of a campaign led jointly by Rochambeau and General George Washington in a decisive march that ended with the defeat of General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown at Yorktown, Virginia , and the Battle of the Chesapeake . Market Square was the center of civic life in the 19th Century, and Market House was home to the city council before City Hall was built. [ 10 ] Incorporation as a city [ edit ] Following the war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city [ a ] [ 9 ] with 7,614 people. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, in particular machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry, and textiles. By the start of the 20th century, Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe , Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware . The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada. Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s. City Hall was built in 1878 In response to these troubles and the economic growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. [ 9 ] City Government [ edit ] From its incorporation as a city in 1832 until 1878, the seat of city government was located in the Market House , [ 11 ] located in Market Square , which was the geographic and social center of the city. The city offices quickly outgrew this building, and in 1845 the City Council resolved to create a permanent municipal building. [ 11 ] The city spent the next 30 years searching for a suitable location, resulting in what some historians have referred to as "Providence's Thirty Years War," as the council bickered over where to site the new building. [ 11 ] Finally, in 1878 the city offices moved into the newly completed City Hall . Civil War [ edit ] During the Civil War , local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Postwar, horsecar lines covering the city enabled its growth and Providence thrived with waves of immigrants and land annexations bringing the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900. [ 9 ] From the 1890s until around 1951, a Chinatown existed around the Burrill Street and Empire Street neighborhoods, which were razed under controversy for a highway extension. Growth and decline [ edit ] The city's boom began to wane in the mid-1920s as industries, notably textiles, shut down. Jewelry manufacturing continued to grow, taking up the slack and employing many of the city's new immigrants, coming from Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Jewish backgrounds. A number of hospitals also opened. The Great Depression hit the city hard, and Providence's downtown was subsequently flooded by the New England Hurricane of 1938 . Though the city received a boost from World War II , this ended with the war. The city saw further decline as a result of nationwide trends, with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization. [ 9 ] The population would drop by 38% over the next three decades. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Providence was a notorious bastion of organized crime . [ 12 ] The mafia boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca ruled a vast criminal enterprise. Renaissance [ edit ] People gathering in Waterplace Park , opened in 1994, just before a WaterFire event. On the left can be seen the Waterplace condominiums, constructed 2008. The entire area had been covered in railroad tracks and the river covered with paved bridges until the late 1980s. The city's "Renaissance" began in the 1970s. From 1975 until 1982, $ 606 million of local and national Community Development funds were invested throughout the city, and the hitherto falling population began to stabilize. In the 1990s, Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci, Jr showcased the city's strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization, ultimately resulting in the uncovering of the city's natural rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges), relocation of a large section of railroad underground, creation of Waterplace Park and river walks along the river's banks, and construction of the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Bank of America Skating Rink) downtown and the 1.4 million ft² Providence Place Mall. [ 9 ] New investment triggered within the city, with new construction including numerous condo projects, hotels, and a new office high-rise all filling in the freed space. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most post-industrial New England cities. Approximately 27.9 percent of the city population is living below the poverty line. [ 15 ] Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005. [ 16 ] Geography [ edit ] Astronaut photograph of Providence, RI taken from the International Space Station (ISS) Downtown Providence and the East Side , 2010. Note the demolition of the previous I-195 as part of the Iway project. The Providence city limits enclose a small geographic region, with a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km 2 ). 18.5 square miles (48 km 2 ) of it is land and the remaining 2.1 square miles (5.4 km 2 ) (roughly 10%) of it is water. Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay , with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, [ 17 ] formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown . Providence is one of many cities claimed, like Rome , to be founded on seven hills . The more prominent hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and is New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point , Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston & Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s. [ 18 ] Neighborhoods [ edit ] Providence neighborhoods with major highways shown, (Technical Note, this map has been deprecated because of relocation of Interstate 195) Main article: Neighborhoods in Providence The Providence skyline viewed from College Hill Providence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively: [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone , Hope (aka Summit), Mount Hope , College Hill , Wayland , and Fox Point . The Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I-95, the old I-195, and the Providence River . The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area's newly developing life sciences and technology-based economy. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The North End is formed by the combination of the neighborhoods of Charles , Wanskuck , Smith Hill , Elmhurst , and Mount Pleasant . The South Side (or South Providence) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood , Lower South Providence , Upper South Providence , and the West End . West Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association. It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End. [ 23 ] The West Side is a vague term sometimes used to mean the West End , Olneyville , and Silver Lake . Cityscape [ edit ] Perspective of Westminster Street Downtown Providence at Burnside Park The Downtown Providence skyline, viewed from College Hill on the city's East Side See also: List of tallest buildings in Providence The city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities that developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country . For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The street layout is irregular—over one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places like Market Square . [ 26 ] Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings, located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two. The newer area, sometimes called "Capitol Center", [ 27 ] includes Providence Place Mall (1999), a Westin hotel (1993) and The Residences at the Westin (2007), GTECH Corporation (2006), Waterplace condominiums (2007), and Waterplace Park (1994); the area tends toward newer development, since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks referred to colloquially as the "Chinese Wall". [ 28 ] This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and intent landscaping. The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure , to date, is the art-deco-styled former Industrial Trust Tower, currently the Bank of America Building at 426 feet (130 m). [ 29 ] By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza , designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half-century later. [ 30 ] In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza . The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade , the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828. [ 31 ] The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, after the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge , like that which it had endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol . [ 32 ] The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses , found so commonly in other Northeast cities, are rare here), [ 33 ] a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. I-95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill , and the West End . Climate [ edit ] Waterplace Park Providence has a humid continental or humid subtropical climate ( Köppen Cfa or Dfa) depending on the January isotherm used, with warm summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA places the city in Hardiness zone 6b, with the suburbs falling in zones 6a - 7b. [ 34 ] The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps Providence, and the rest of the state of Rhode Island, [ 35 ] warmer than many inland locales in New England. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] January is the coldest month with a daily mean of 29.2 °F (−1.6 °C), and low temperatures dropping to 10 °F (−12 °C) or lower an average of 11 days per winter, [ 38 ] while July is the warmest month with a daily mean of 73.5 °F (23.1 °C), and highs rising to 90 °F (32 °C) or higher an average of 10 days per summer. [ 38 ] Extremes range from −17 °F (−27 °C) on February 9, 1934 to 104 °F (40 °C) on August 2, 1975; [ 39 ] the record cold daily maximum is 1 °F (−17 °C) on February 5, 1918, while the record warm daily minimum is 80 °F (27 °C) on June 6, 1925. [ 38 ] Temperature readings of 0 °F (−18 °C) or lower are uncommon in Providence, and generally occur once every several years. The year which had the most days with a temperature reading of zero degrees or lower was 2015 with eight days total; one day in January and seven days in February. [ 38 ] Conversely, temperature readings of 100 °F (38 °C) or higher are even rarer, and the year with the most days in this category was 1944 with three days, all of which were in August. [ 38 ] As with the rest of the northeastern seaboard, Providence receives ample precipitation year-round. Monthly precipitation ranges from a high of 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July. [ 39 ] In general, precipitation levels are slightly lesser in the summer months than the winter months, when powerful storms known as Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Although hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England , Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them. Climate data for Providence, Rhode Island ( T. F.

The population density was 9,401.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,629.4/km²), characteristic of comparatively older cities in New England such as New Haven , Connecticut ; Springfield , Massachusetts , and Hartford , Connecticut . [ 48 ] Also like these cities, its population peaked in the 1940s just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization . Providence has a racially and ethnically diverse population. In 2010, White Americans formed 49.8% of the population, including a sizable White Hispanic community. Non-Hispanic whites , historically predominant in the city, were 37.6% of the total population, [ 45 ] down from 89.5% in 1970. [ 46 ] Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the start of the 20th century, with 14% (a plurality [ c ] ) of the population claiming Italian ancestry. [ 49 ] Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill . [ 50 ] Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. [ 51 ] The city also has a small Jewish community, estimated at 7,500 in 2002 or roughly 4% of the city's population. [ 52 ] In 2010, people of Hispanic or Latino origin comprised 27.8% of the city's population and currently form a majority of city public school students. [ 45 ] of Providence's population. [ 53 ] The largest Hispanic groups are those having origins in Puerto Rico , Colombia , Bolivia , the Dominican Republic , and Guatemala . Hispanics are most concentrated in the neighborhoods of Elmwood , the West End , Upper , and Lower South Providence . [ 54 ] The city elected its first Hispanic mayor in 2010, Dominican-American Angel Taveras. African Americans constitute 16% [ 45 ] of the city's population, with their greatest concentrations found in Mount Hope and Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. The largest Asian groups are Cambodians (1.7%), Chinese (1.1%), Asian Indians (0.7%), Laotians (0.6%), and Koreans (0.6%). [ 56 ] Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. Native Americans and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. With Liberians comprising 0.4% of the population, [ 49 ] the city is home to one of the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country. [ 57 ] Providence, like some nearby Massachusetts communities, has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries (especially Portugal , Brazil , and Cape Verde ), living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] [ 60 ] Portuguese is the city's third-largest European ethnicity, (after Italian and Irish) at 4% of the population; Cape Verdeans comprise 2%. [ 49 ] The Providence metropolitan area , which includes Providence, Fall River , Massachusetts , and Warwick is estimated to have a population of 1,622,520. In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area (CSA), the fifth-largest CSA in the country . In the last fifteen years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population. The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20- to 24-year-olds, owing to the city's large student population. [ 45 ] [ 61 ] The per capita income , as of the 2000 census , was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113, [ 62 ] and the national average of $21,587. [ 63 ] The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville , and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. [ 15 ] [ 64 ] Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate, with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated in particular west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford , Federal Hill , and Olneyville.
