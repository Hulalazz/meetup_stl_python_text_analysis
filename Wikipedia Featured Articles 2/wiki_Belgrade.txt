It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, where the Pannonian Plain meets the Balkans . [ 5 ] Its name translates to "White city". The city proper has a population of 1.23 million, while over 1.65 million people live within the administrative limits. [ 1 ] One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vinča culture , evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco - Dacians inhabited the region, and after 279 BC Celts conquered the city, naming it Singidūn . [ 6 ] It was conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus , and awarded city rights in the mid-2nd century. [ 7 ] It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, Frankish Empire, Bulgarian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary before it became the capital of Serbian king Stephen Dragutin (1282–1316). In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo . [ 8 ] It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars . Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when the city was reunited. As a strategic location, the city was battled over in 115 wars and razed to the ground 44 times. [ 9 ] Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia (in various forms of governments) from its creation in 1918, to its final dissolution in 2006 . Belgrade has a special administrative status within Serbia [ 10 ] and it is one of five statistical regions of Serbia. Its metropolitan territory is divided into 17 municipalities , each with its own local council. [ 11 ] It covers 3.6% of Serbia's territory, and 22.5% of the country's population lives in the city. [ 12 ] Belgrade has been awarded many titles, and is classified as a Beta- global city.

The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan , lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, Novi Beograd ( New Belgrade ) was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun . Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnjača , Kotež and Borča , also merged with the city, while Pančevo , a heavily industrialized satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km 2 (1,244 sq mi). Throughout history, Belgrade has been a crossroads between the West and the Orient . [ 14 ] On the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus . [ 15 ] Climate [ edit ] Kalemegdan Park . Belgrade lies in the humid subtropical (Cfa) climate zone , with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 °C (34.5 °F) in January to 23.0 °C (73.4 °F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 °C (54.5 °F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 °C, and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 °C. Belgrade receives about 690 millimetres (27 in) of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112. The highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was +43.6 °C (110 °F) on 24 July 2007, [ 16 ] while on the other end, the lowest temperature was −26.2 °C (−15 °F) on 10 January 1893.

Some of these tools belong to the Mousterian industry , which are associated with Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered there, indicating occupation between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago. [ 19 ] The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Starčevo culture , which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. [ 20 ] There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Starčevo . The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the Vinča culture (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region ( Vinča-Belo Brdo ). The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continious habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe; [ 21 ] anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinča ; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe; [ 22 ] a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans , known as the Old European script , dating back to around 5300 BC. [ 23 ] Ancient city [ edit ] The medieval walls of the Belgrade Fortress , where they discovered the walls of the Roman castrum Singidunum Evidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from ancient myths and legends. The rock overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers has been identified as one of the place in the story of Jason and the Argonauts . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The Paleo-Balkan tribes of Thracians and Dacians ruled this area prior to the Roman conquest. [ 26 ] Belgrade was inhabited by a Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi ; [ 6 ] after the Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci took the city, naming it "Singidūn" ( dūn , fortress). [ 6 ] In 34–33 BC the Roman army led by Silanus reached Belgrade. It became the romanized Singidunum in the 1st century AD, and by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (highest city class) by the end of the century. [ 7 ] Apart from the first Christian Emperor of Rome who was born on the territory in modern Serbia in Naissus – Constantine I known as Constantine the Great [ 27 ] – another early Roman Emperor was born in Singidunum: Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), the restorer of Christianity. [ 28 ] Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire , ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate . In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire . [ 29 ] Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun) ; the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times. [ 30 ] Middle Ages [ edit ] See also: Serbia in the Middle Ages Belgrade Fortress Clock Tower In 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun . [ 31 ] In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great , who continued into Greece . [ 32 ] As the Ostrogoths left for Italy , the Gepids took over the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. [ 33 ] In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum , pillaging cities and settling down. [ 34 ] The Avars under Bayan I conquered the whole region by 582. [ 35 ] According to Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio , the White Serbs had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610–641). [ 36 ] In 829 Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal letter [ 39 ] to Bulgarian ruler Boris I . Later, this name appeared in several variants: Alba Graeca (Greek city), Griechisch Wiessenburg (Greek white castle), Nandor Alba (City of the Bulgarians), Nandor Fejervar (The white castle of the Bulgarians) - still named like this in the Hungarian transltation of the city, Castelbianco (White Castle), Alba Bulgarica (Bulgarian City). For about four centuries, the city remained a battleground between the Byzantine Empire , the Kingdom of Hungary and the Bulgarian Empire . [ 40 ] Basil II (976–1025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. [ 41 ] The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade ; [ 42 ] while passing through during the Third Crusade , Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins. [ 43 ] Siege of 1456 , Ottoman miniature. Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276–1282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary in 1284; it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia , and Dragutin is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary. [ 44 ] Following the battles at Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389) , Serbia began to crumble as the Ottoman Empire conquered its southern territory. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The north resisted through the Serbian Despotate , which had Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarević , son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović . Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist the Ottomans for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population of 40,000 to 50,000 people. [ 44 ] In 1427, Stefan's successor Đurađ Branković had to return Belgrade to the Hungarian king , and Smederevo became the new capital. Although the Ottomans captured most of the Serbian Despotate , Belgrade, known as Nándorfehérvár in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 [ 42 ] and 1456. [ 47 ] As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers [ 48 ] besieged it in 1456 , in which the Christian army successfully defended it. [ 49 ] The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day. [ 42 ] [ 50 ] Ottoman conquest and Austrian invasions [ edit ] See also: History of Ottoman Serbia Belgrade in 1684 Seven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Ottoman Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent and his 250,000 soldiers; subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul , [ 42 ] to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest . [ 51 ] Belgrade was made the seat of the district ( Sanjak ), becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople . [ 48 ] Ottoman rule also introduced Ottoman architecture , including numerous mosques, increasing the city's Oriental influences. [ 52 ] In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vračar plateau ; in the 20th century, the Temple of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event. [ 53 ] Austrian conquest of Belgrade: 1717 by Eugene of Savoy , during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18 Occupied by the Habsburgs three times ( 1688–1690 , 1717–1739 , 1789–1791 ), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy , [ 54 ] and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. [ 52 ] During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations , in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by their patriarchs , retreated together with the Austrians into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia . [ 55 ] Capital of independent Serbia [ edit ] Statue of Prince Mihailo III on Republic Square During the First Serbian Uprising , the Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. [ 56 ] After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia reached semi-independence, which was formally recognized by the Porte in 1830. [ 57 ] In 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenović moved the capital from Kragujevac to Belgrade. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] In May 1868, Prince Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinović while riding in a carriage through the park of his country residence [ 60 ] With the Principality 's full independence in 1878, and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. [ 56 ] [ 61 ] Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia as a whole remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Niš , Serbia's second city, and in 1900 the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants [ 62 ] (at the time Serbia numbered 1.5 million). Yet by 1905 the population had grown to more than 80,000, and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, not counting Zemun which then belonged to Austria-Hungary . [ 63 ] The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade, in June 1896 by Andre Carr, a representative of the Lumière brothers . He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. [ 64 ] World War I and the Interbellum [ edit ] King Alexander Bridge was destroyed in 1941 and rebuilt after the end of World War II, 1956, as a single-span bridge. Knez Mihailova street at the end of the 19th century Terazije 1934 The First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik . After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, between 6 and 9 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October 1915. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Espérey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia . Since Belgrade was decimated as the front-line city, Subotica overtook the title of the largest city in the Kingdom for a short while. [ 65 ] After the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes , renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas , and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pančevo , formed a separate administrative unit. [ 66 ] During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (incorporating the town of Zemun, formerly in Austria-Hungary), and 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year. [ 67 ] In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pančevo Bridge , which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, [ 68 ] while "King Alexander Bridge" over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix , the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. [ 69 ] The winner was Tazio Nuvolari . [ 70 ] Republic square 1934 World War II [ edit ] On 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact , joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'état led by Air Force commander General Dušan Simović , who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. Consequently, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, when up to 24,000 people were killed. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Yugoslavia was then invaded by German , Italian , Hungarian , and Bulgarian forces, Belgrade was occupied by the German Army on 13 April 1941 and suburbs as far east as Zemun , in the Belgrade metropolitan area, were incorporated into a Nazi state , the Independent State of Croatia . Belgrade became the seat of the Nedić regime , headed by General Milan Nedić . During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz Böhme , the German Military Governor of Serbia. Böhme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. [ 73 ] The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major Žarko Todorović from 1941 until his arrest in 1943. [ 74 ] Just like Rotterdam , which was devastated twice, by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing about 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter . [ 75 ] Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans . On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). [ 76 ] Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000. [ 77 ] After World War II [ edit ] During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia , developing as a major industrial center. [ 61 ] In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police. [ 78 ] In 1960, architect Svetislav Tisa Milosavljević died there of natural causes. Breakup of Yugoslavia [ edit ] Hotel Moskva, Terazije On 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Drašković were held in the city against Slobodan Milošević . [ 79 ] According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. [ 80 ] Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. [ 81 ] Further protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud at local elections. [ 82 ] These protests brought Zoran Đinđić to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia . [ 83 ] Knez Miloševa street with building damaged during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 (building on the right side) In 1999, during the Kosovo War , NATO bombings caused substantial damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were the buildings of several ministries, the RTS building, which killed 16 technicians , several hospitals, the Hotel Jugoslavija , the Central Committee building , the Avala Tower , and the Chinese embassy . [ 84 ] Several of these buildings have been left in their bombed states to serve as a memorial for the bombings. [ 85 ] After the 2000 presidential elections , Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milošević . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] In modern Serbia [ edit ] In 2015, an agreement was reached with Eagle Hills (a UAE company) on the Belgrade Waterfront deal, for the construction of a new part of the city on currently undeveloped wasteland by the riverside. This project, officially started in September 2015 and is the biggest construction project in Europe, will cost at least 3.5 billion euros. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Administration [ edit ] Belgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority. [ 10 ] The City Assembly of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. [ 90 ] A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the City Administration, [ 91 ] which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes. [ 92 ] The 2014 Belgrade local elections were won by the Serbian Progressive Party , which formed a wide ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia and Democratic Party of Serbia . These elections ended the long-time rule of the Democratic Party , which elected mayors from 2004 to 2013. [ 93 ] The Mayor of Belgrade is Siniša Mali , a political independent affiliated with the Serbian Progressive Party. [ 94 ] The city's budget for 2013 was 82.8 billion dinars (approximately $1 billion US dollars). [ 95 ] As the capital city of Serbia, Belgrade hosts many governmental institutions including the National Assembly and Government of Serbia , as well as 75 diplomatic missions . [ 96 ] Panoramic view of Belgrade and the confluence of the Sava River and the Danube from Belgrade Fortress . Municipalities [ edit ] See also: Subdivisions of Belgrade Gardoš Tower in Zemun . Novi dvor The city is divided into 17 municipalities. [ 11 ] Previously, they were classified into 10 "urban" (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 "suburban" municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns. [ 97 ] With the new 2010 City statute, they were all given equal status, with the proviso that suburban ones (except Surčin) have certain autonomous powers, chiefly related with construction, infrastructure and public utilities.
