It was released as the lead single from the album on March 17, 2008, by Warner Bros. Records . According to Madonna, the song is about saving the environment and "hav[ing] a good time while we are doing it". She also cited the song as the inspiration for the documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The song was recorded at Sarm West Studios , in London, while the mixing of the track was finished at The Hit Factory studio, in Miami. Sound engineer Demo Castellon first worked on the vocals and then on the beats, while the synths were composed by Timbaland and Danja. An uptempo dance-pop song with an urban and hip hop style, "4 Minutes" incorporates Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats and the instrumentation used in the song includes brass , foghorns and cowbells . The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed in the continent. "4 Minutes" received positive reviews from critics , who called it a busy dance track and complimented its music, which was compared to that of a marching band. Some reviewers noted that it was Madonna who appeared more of a featured artist on the track, rather than Timberlake. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 , giving Madonna her 37th top-ten single, breaking the record previously held by Elvis Presley , as the artist with most top-ten hits. Internationally, "4 Minutes" topped the chart in 21 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the song's accompanying music video , Madonna and Timberlake sing and run away from a giant black screen that devours everything in its path. At the end of the video, both of them are consumed by the screen. "4 Minutes" was performed by Madonna on the promotional tour for Hard Candy and the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour . In the latter, the song served as the opener of the rave segment, where Madonna wore a futuristic robotic outfit. During performances of the song, Timberlake and Timbaland appeared on video screens and sang their lines. The song received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals and Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical at the 2009 ceremony .

We'd sit down and we'd start talking about situations. And then we'd start talking about issues or problems or relationships with people. That was the only way, because you know, writing together with somebody is very intimate. So we had to find a place to start talking about something we cared about, so we could get into writing about something we cared about." [ 1 ] —Madonna talking to Interview about the writing process. Following the release of her tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Madonna wanted to record more dance music. [ 2 ] When asked by producer Stuart Price what kind of music appealed to her, Madonna replied that she loved the records of singer Justin Timberlake and producer Timbaland , so she collaborated with them. [ 2 ] "4 Minutes" was written by all three artists, along with Nate "Danja" Hills , [ 3 ] and produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Danja. [ 4 ] The song, initially named "4 Minutes to Save the World", was one of the last to be produced for Madonna's album Hard Candy . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] In an interview with MTV News , Madonna said that the concept of the song was developed through discussions with Timberlake. She further explained the meaning of the song: I don't think it's important to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much more aware of the environment and how we're destroying the planet. We can't just keep distracting ourselves we do have to educate ourselves and wake up and do something about it. You know at the same time we don't want to be boring and serious and not have fun so it's kind of like well if we're going to save the planet can we have a good time while we are doing it? [ 6 ] Madonna clarified that her age did not have anything to do with the sense of urgency reflected in the track; instead, it was just something that she had in mind for a long time and with "4 Minutes", the sense seeped into her music. [ 2 ] Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". [ 1 ] Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was "a funny paradox" and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi. [ 1 ] Recording and mixing [ edit ] The recording sessions for "4 Minutes" took place at Sarm West Studios in West London, on a 72-channel SSL 9080 scratching tool. Paul Tingen from Sound on Sound magazine interviewed mixing and recording engineer Demacio "Demo" Castellon, who recalled that he did not attend the first recording sessions "because [he] was working on another project, but [he] was lucky enough to go in for the second set of sessions". [ 7 ] Over half of the song was already done by the time Castellon arrived, including the drum sounds to the basic keyboard lines. According to him, he "recorded the rest, and [he] also did some programming, particularly in the intro and the end." [ 7 ] At Sarm, Timbaland and Danja used Akai MPC3000 and Ensoniq ASR-10 sampling drum machines , Yamaha Motif workstation and synths to build the backing track for "4 Minutes". "There were dedicated analogue keyboards and the rest were soft synths. But we're always experimenting and we're always using whatever equipment we have in the studio we work in. We may have our preferences, but we're always into trying new things. That's why our stuff sounds different to that of everybody else." [ 7 ] Castellon said that the "4 Minutes" background "consists mainly of brass, synths, and percussion." Castellon asserted that the session was "actually much bigger than most people would think, because Tim and Danja take a lot of pride in designing their own sounds [...] The drums and percussion on '4 Minutes' are 23 stereo tracks, so 46 tracks in total, there were 16 stereo tracks of brass, and so on. The whole session panned out to about 100 tracks, and I took 80 outputs from Pro Tools to the SSL, so there was some submixing in Pro Tools. But for the most part it was straight across the board." [ 7 ] In the interview, Castellon gave his opinion of Timbaland's production, as well as his own production work: In the case of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the beginning of how things should go, especially sonically. He's a real producer. He doesn't look only at the music, he looks at the sounds as well. He's also a great engineer and he has an incredible ear and he knows exactly how to piece things together in the stereo spectrum. [...] When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be to make sure that the vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close. [ 7 ] Castellon said that he did not want the SSL's internal automation to interfere with his blending of the music, which he said "has happened". [ 7 ] Instead, the automation was from Pro Tools, with levels set using an eight-fader CM Labs Motormix controller belonging to Castellon. According to him, he "then ran everything through the SSL, on which [he] did EQ, compression and panning." [ 7 ] The mixing of the track was made at The Hit Factory studio, in Miami on a 96-channel SSL J-series desk. Considering the quantity of recorded backing tracks, a challenge in mixing "4 Minutes" was, according to Castellon, "making sure that the music didn't overwhelm the vocals." [ 7 ] Castellon explained how he did this: "I started with the vocals, then I added in the music, and the drums were last. That's unusual for me, even though I don't really have a set way of mixing." [ 7 ] Very few digital plug-ins were employed for the mix as Castellon preferred the sound of outboard gear . He tried to complete the song quickly, which took him a day of work to mix. After two days, he fine-tuned the mix. [ 7 ] After the mixes were done, Castellon began working with the vocals, he started with Timbaland's introduction part, continued with Madonna's voice, and finished with Timberlake's vocals. On Timbaland's vocals, he utilized the SSL's EQ to reduce "some bottom end", and he set input levels to avoid clipping when the singing was very loud. [ 7 ] For Madonna and Timberlake he used a little of the SSL's dynamic range compression , and on Madonna's voice he applied "an eighth-note delay from a [Lexicon] PCM42", and a reverb from the Eventide H3500 for the verse and the [TC Electronic] TC3000 for the hook." [ 7 ] These digital signal processors were employed to give Madonna's vocals a sense of stereophonic space . Castellon commended Timbaland and Danja's drum programming, but felt that it was "too good sometimes", requiring him to "turn down things a little bit." [ 7 ] Castellon applied the Waves Audio "Renaissance Compressor" plug-in to control the level of kick drum . He said, "there was one particular kick sound there that clashed with the other tracks, so Tim replaced it with another kick that had a very different note and sound." [ 7 ] Castellon said that using a Focusrite D2 EQ let him "match the sound of that new kick drum to the other kick drum sounds". [ 7 ] Once the drums and percussion were added, the recording and mixing of "4 Minutes" was finished. Castellon concluded, "[l]uckily everything came together in the end. I don't think the mix would have sounded the same if I had worked in the opposite way, starting with the drums and working up towards the vocals."

Madonna and Justin Timberlake trade the verses Problems playing this file? See media help . "4 Minutes" is an uptempo dance-pop song, [ 8 ] composed in an urban , hip hop style. [ 9 ] It incorporates the effect of a marching band, [ 1 ] [ 5 ] a clanging beat and instrumentation from a brass that is played in a "scale-like riff", as described by Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone . [ 5 ] Other musical instruments used are foghorns and cow bells . [ 10 ] In "4 Minutes", Madonna and Timberlake sing and trade verses , [ 5 ] the rhythm moves towards a hard clanging beat as Madonna sings the lines that the "road to hell is paved with good intentions." Madonna and Timberlake start singing the chorus with Timberlake singing the line of "We've only got four minutes to save the world". [ 5 ] The track continues in the same momentum in the second verse and second chorus whence the track ends where every beat ceases except for Timbaland's characteristic bhangra beats, the brass riffs and Madonna singing the words "tick-tock" repeatedly, after which it ends. [ 5 ] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing , the song is written in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 115 beats per minute . [ 11 ] Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start and the end of the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F 3 to Bb 5 . [ 11 ] The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B ♭ –D in the verses and E ♭ 5 –D 5 –C 5 –D 5 in the chorus, as its chord progression . [ 11 ] The lyrics of "4 Minutes" carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. [ 1 ] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that "[h]owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. [ 12 ] Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line " The road to hell is paved with good intentions " did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [ 13 ] Regarding the line "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, "[y]eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." [ 1 ] Critical reception [ edit ] Madonna performing "4 Minutes" during the Sticky & Sweet tour on 2009. On the backdrop screens, Timberlake can be seen. Caryn Ganz called it "a loud, busy, energetic track", and commented that Timberlake did "his best Michael Jackson impression". [ 5 ] Billboard music reviewer and editor Chuck Taylor said that with the song, Madonna "is poised to score her first top 10 hit since 2005's 'Hung Up'. [...] There's an awful lot going on in the busy dance track [...] but the trade-off chorus between Madge and Justin of 'We've only got four minutes to save the world' is hooky enough unto itself to sell the song." He added that the song "qualifies as an event record between superpowers [Madonna and Timberlake] who not only share equal billing, but sound gangbusters together." [ 10 ] Mark Savage of BBC described the sound as "so futuristic it could realistically have been beamed in from the end of the world." [ 14 ] Andy Gill of The Independent called "4 Minutes" one of Hard Candy ' s saviors. He noted that "the Mardi Gras marching-band bumping rambunctiously along," is one of the album's "most ambitious offerings." [ 15 ] Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle compared the track to the work of Nelly Furtado and felt that the composition was "a bid for radio play." [ 16 ] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song is an "advertisement for the rest of the album." [ 17 ] Chris Williams of Entertainment Weekly called it a "flirty duet". [ 18 ] Ben Thompson of The Guardian said: "It has a hard to escape sense that all concerned are going through the motions [of life] – effortlessly, sometimes brilliantly." [ 19 ] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe believed that the song is "chart-topper for its sheer star power as well as instant musical allure, and on the eve of Madonna's 50th birthday [...] '4 Minutes' feels a lot like an icon's can't-miss gift to herself." However, she noticed that the "shift in the power structure [is nowhere] more blatant than on '4 Minutes', where Madonna sounds like a featured guest trying to keep pace with Timbaland's colossal beats and Timberlake's nimble melody." [ 20 ] Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post complimented the song for being busy and brassy. She commented: "[P]ropelled by a detonative marching-band beat [...] it's one of the most thrilling things Madonna has done in this decade." [ 21 ] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the melodic and rhythmic hook , but was disappointed that Madonna's voice is "drowned out by Timbaland's farting four-note synth – which might not have been so bad if the tracks were fresher and if the whole enterprise didn't feel quite so joylessly mechanical." [ 22 ] At the 51st Grammy Awards , "4 Minutes" garnered Madonna, Timberlake and Timbaland a nomination in the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals category. Dutch musician Junkie XL also earned a nomination in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category for his remix of the song.

This leap was spurred by first-week digital sales of 217,000, enabling the song to enter Billboard ' s Digital chart at number two, behind Mariah Carey 's single " Touch My Body ". The song became Madonna's first top-ten single since " Hung Up " (2005), and was her 37th Hot 100 top-ten hit, breaking the record previously held by Elvis Presley .

[ 52 ] Music video [ edit ] A still from the music video showing Madonna and Timberlake. The black background is seen behind Timberlake, devouring his sides. The music video was directed by French duo Jonas & François in London, England. [ 5 ] [ 53 ] It featured choreography by Jamie King , who worked on Madonna's Confessions , Re-Invention and Drowned World tours as well as her video for the single " Sorry " (2006). [ 5 ] Japanese hip hop dancing duo Hamutsun Serve also made an appearance in the video. [ 54 ] Before its release, Rolling Stone said that in the video Madonna and Timberlake act as if they were "superheroes" while they evade multiple obstacles. [ 5 ] In the video, Madonna wore a cream colored corset, glistening black boots and styled her hair in platinum blond waves while Timberlake wore mainly denims and a scarf around his neck. [ 9 ] Regarding the idea behind the music video, Madonna said that "it was conceptualistic". She explained that the video was shot like a march past ; "It's a movement, and we want to take everybody with us." [ 1 ] About the idea of a black screen devouring everything, Madonna said, None of us did [understand the concept of the black screen]. It was just, you know, it's very conceptual. We basically gave the song to the two French directors [Jonas & Francois] and they came up with the only concept that I thought was interesting, with this black sort of amorphous graphic line slowly eating up the world. I just liked that as a concept. [ 6 ] The video used soft focus , gentle lighting and airbrushing looks on Madonna. [ 55 ] It starts with Timbaland chanting the opening line in front of a giant timer screen that counts down from four minutes. As he sings, a black geometric patterned screen comes from behind and engulfs all of the musical devices present. Madonna and Timberlake enter a house but run away from it after finding the screen there, which starts eating the hands and legs of the inhabitants of the house, thus showing their insides. After a number of shots showing Madonna and Timberlake jumping on and over cars to escape from the screen, they finally move into a supermarket. The screen follows them, consuming the long lines of stalls and the people present there. [ 9 ] As the second chorus starts, they arrive in front of the screen where Timbaland is singing. After choreographed dancing, Madonna performs a back arch as the timer reaches zero time. [ 55 ] The last "tick-tock, tick-tock" sound is heard, Madonna and Timberlake dance again on a long stage; the black screen approaches them from both sides. The video ends with both of them kissing, and the black screen devouring them. Timberlake's bones and ribs, and Madonna's cheeks are seen in the last shot. [ 55 ] Regarding the video, Madonna said it was like "[g]oody goody gum drops," referring to the candy-oriented theme of the album. [ 9 ] Virginia Heffernan from The New York Times called the video heart-pounding, and compared its momentum with the music video of " Thriller , " In the Air Tonight " and "Shadows of the Night". [ 56 ] However, Eric Wilson from the same newspaper commented that the video did not yield a breakout Madonna look compared to her videos from the 1980s. [ 57 ] Singer Miley Cyrus created her own version of the video and posted it on her YouTube channel. Madonna responded to it in her own video and said, "All you people out there who are making videos to my new single, '4 Minutes,' keep up the good work, nice job." [ 58 ] "4 Minutes" was nominated for an award at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards in the "Best Dancing in a Video" category, but lost to the Pussycat Dolls ' single " When I Grow Up ".
