Founded in 1789, it is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in the United States. Located in Washington's historic Georgetown neighborhood , the university's main campus is noted for Healy Hall , a National Historic Landmark . Georgetown's law school is located on Capitol Hill , and the university has auxiliary campuses in Italy , Turkey , and Qatar . Georgetown's founding by John Carroll , America's first Catholic bishop , realized efforts dating from the settlement of the province of Maryland in 1634 to establish a local Roman Catholic college in the face of religious persecution. The university expanded after the American Civil War under the leadership of Patrick Francis Healy , who came to be known as Georgetown's "second founder" despite having been born a slave by law. Jesuits have participated in the university's administration since 1805, a heritage Georgetown celebrates, but the university has always been governed independently of the Society of Jesus and of church authorities. Comprising 9 undergraduate and graduate schools, the university has about 7,000 undergraduate and over 10,000 post-graduate students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including 130 foreign countries. [ 9 ] The university's most notable alumni are prominent in public life in the United States and abroad. Among them are former U.S. President Bill Clinton , U.S. Chief Justice Edward Douglass White , U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia , dozens of U.S. governors and members of Congress , heads of state or government of more than a dozen countries , royalty and diplomats . Campus organizations include the country's largest student-run business and largest student-run financial institution . Georgetown's athletic teams, nicknamed the Hoyas , include a men's basketball team that has won a record-tying seven Big East championships , appeared in five Final Fours , and won a national championship in 1984 , as well as a co-ed sailing team that holds nine national championship and one world championship title.

[ 10 ] However, the 1646 defeat of the Royalists in the English Civil War led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including Andrew White , and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor. [ 1 ] During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the end of the American Revolution that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized. [ 11 ] John Carroll published his proposals for a school at Georgetown in 1787, after the American Revolution allowed for the free practice of religion. Because of Benjamin Franklin 's recommendation, Pope Pius VI appointed former Jesuit John Carroll as the first head of the Roman Catholic Church in America , even though the papal suppression of the Jesuit order was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near Annapolis, Maryland , where they orchestrated the development of a new university. [ 12 ] On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built. [ 13 ] Future Congressman William Gaston was enrolled as the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792. [ 12 ] During its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands owned by ex-Jesuits. [ 14 ] The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college. [ 15 ] The United States Congress issued Georgetown the first federal university charter in 1815, which allowed it to confer degrees, and the first bachelor's degrees were awarded two years later. [ 16 ] In 1844, the school received a corporate charter, under the name " The President and Directors of Georgetown College ", affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the Medical School was founded in 1851. [ 17 ] Civil War [ edit ] Union soldiers across the Potomac River from Georgetown University in 1861 The U.S. Civil War greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141 students and alumni enlisted in one army or the other, and the Union Army commandeered university buildings. [ 11 ] By the time of President Abraham Lincoln 's May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400 troops were living in temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost, enrollment levels remained low until well after the war was over. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade. [ 18 ] At its founding in 1876, the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, adopted blue, used for Union uniforms , and gray, used for Confederate uniforms , as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students. [ 19 ] Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors. Enrollment did not recover from the war until the presidency of Patrick Francis Healy from 1873 to 1881. Born a slave by law, Healy was the first acknowledged head of a predominantly white American university with African heritage . [b] He is credited with reforming the undergraduate curriculum , lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the Alumni Association . One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named Healy Hall in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's "second founder." [ 20 ] Expansion [ edit ] Patrick Francis Healy helped transform the school into a modern university after the Civil War. After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education . [ 15 ] The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. [ 21 ] Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the University in 1927. [ 22 ] The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh , to prepare students for leadership in diplomacy and foreign commerce. [ 15 ] The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956. [ 23 ] The School of Business was created out of the SFS in 1957, and in 1998 was renamed the McDonough School of Business in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough. [ 24 ] Besides expansion of the University, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university was made available on a limited basis by 1952. [ 25 ] With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969–1970 academic year , Georgetown became fully coeducational . [ 26 ] Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing Leo J. O'Donovan as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to build the school's endowment. [ 27 ] In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign after raising over $1 billion for financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects. [ 28 ] John J. DeGioia , Georgetown's first lay president, has led the school since 2001, and has continued its financial modernization and sought to "expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue", such as by opening a campus in Qatar . [ 29 ] Jesuit tradition [ edit ] Students studying outside Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of Ignatius of Loyola and is a member of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities . [ 13 ] [ 30 ] Georgetown is not a pontifical university , though seven Jesuits serve on the thirty-six member Board of Directors , the school's highest governance. [ 31 ] Fifty-two members of the Society of Jesus live on campus, and are mostly employed by Georgetown as professors or administrators. [ 32 ] Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition. [ 33 ] The role that Georgetown's Catholic heritage has played in its policies has been controversial at times, even as its influence is relatively limited. [ 34 ] Stores in University-owned buildings are not allowed to sell or distribute birth control products. [ 35 ] Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown University Hospital , operated by MedStar Health , are prohibited from performing abortions. [ 36 ] As recently as 2004, the hospital did perform research using embryonic stem cells . [ 37 ] Georgetown has drawn criticism from religious groups such as the Cardinal Newman Society for hosting speeches from prominent pro-choice politicians, including John Kerry and Barack Obama , [ 38 ] [ 39 ] and from Washington's Archbishop , Donald Wuerl , for inviting Kathleen Sebelius to be a commencement speaker. [ 40 ] The university does host the Cardinal O'Connor Conference on Life every January to discuss the pro-life movement. [ 41 ] Between 1996 and 1999, crucifixes were added to many classroom walls, attracting national attention. [ 42 ] Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. [ 43 ] Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. [ 44 ] According to Imam Yahya Hendi , the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. [ 45 ] The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. [ 46 ] Academics [ edit ] College/school Year founded Georgetown College 1789 Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1820 School of Medicine 1851 Law Center 1870 School of Nursing and Health Studies 1903 Walsh School of Foreign Service 1919 School of Dentistry (defunct) 1951 School of Continuing Studies 1956 McDonough School of Business 1957 McCourt School of Public Policy 2013 As of 2014 [update] , the University has 7,636 undergraduate students, and 10,213 graduate students. [ 4 ] Bachelor's programs are offered through Georgetown College , the School of Nursing and Health Studies , the Robert Emmett McDonough School of Business , the School of Continuing Studies , and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service , which includes the Qatar campus . The now-defunct School of Dentistry closed in 1990 after 89 years in operation. [ 47 ] Some high school students from Georgetown Visitation are permitted to attend classes for Advanced Placement credit. [ 48 ] Healy Hall houses classrooms and the university's executive body. Georgetown University offers undergraduate degrees in forty-eight majors in the four undergraduate schools, as well as the opportunity for students to design their own individualized courses of study. [ 49 ] All majors in the College are open as minors to students in the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and the School of Business. Students in the School of Foreign Service cannot receive minors, but can complete certificates instead. All courses are on a credit hour system. [ 15 ] Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad , and about 50% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution overseas. [ 50 ] Master's and doctoral programs are offered through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences , the Law Center, the School of Medicine, the McCourt School of Public Policy , and the School of Continuing Studies. Masters students occasionally share some advanced seminars with undergraduates, and most undergraduate schools offer abbreviated bachelors and masters programs following completion of the undergraduate degree. The McDonough School of Business and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service both offer masters programs. The School of Foreign Service is renowned for its academic programs in international affairs. Its graduate program was ranked first in the world by Foreign Policy and its undergraduate program was ranked fourth. [ 51 ] The Center for Contemporary Arab Studies also offer a Master's of Arab Studies, as well as certificates. [ 52 ] Each graduate school offers at least one double degree with another graduate school. [ 53 ] Additionally, the Law Center offers a joint degree with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health . [ 54 ] The School of Continuing Studies includes the Center for Continuing and Professional Education, and operates four types of degree programs, over thirty professional certificates and non-degree courses, undergraduate and graduate degrees in Liberal Studies , as well as summer courses for graduates, undergraduates, and high school students. [ 55 ] Faculty [ edit ] Main article: List of Georgetown University faculty University president John J. DeGioia is also a faculty member in philosophy. As of 2012 [update] , Georgetown University employed 1,354 full-time and 880 part-time faculty members across its three Washington, D.C. campuses, [ 4 ] with additional staff at SFS-Qatar . [ 56 ] The faculty comprises leading academics and notable political and business leaders, and are predominantly male by a two-to-one margin. [ 57 ] Politically, Georgetown University's faculty members give more support to liberal candidates, and while their donation patterns are generally consistent with those of other American university faculties, they gave more than average to Barack Obama's presidential campaign . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The current faculty includes scholars such as the former President of the American Philological Association James J. O'Donnell , theologian John Haught , social activists Sam Marullo and Chai Feldblum , Nobel laureate George Akerlof , and preeminent hip-hop scholar Michael Eric Dyson . [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Many former politicians choose to teach at Georgetown, including the former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick , U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Andrew Natsios , National Security Advisor Anthony Lake , and CIA director George Tenet . Internationally, the school attracts numerous former ambassadors and heads of state , such as Prime Minister of Spain José María Aznar , Saudi Ambassador Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud , and President of Colombia Álvaro Uribe . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Research [ edit ] Lauinger Library , Georgetown's main library, was built in 1970. Georgetown University is a self-described "student-centered research university" [ 66 ] considered by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to have "very high research activity." [ 67 ] As of 2014 [update] , Georgetown's libraries held over 3.5 million printed items, including 1.25 million e-books, in seven buildings, with most in Lauinger Library . [ 68 ] The Blommer Science Library, located in the Reiss Science Building on campus, houses most of the Science collection. Additionally, the Law School campus includes the nation's fifth largest law library . [ 69 ] Georgetown faculty conduct research in hundreds of subjects, but have priorities in the fields of religion, ethics, science, public policy, and cancer medicine. [ 70 ] Cross-institutional research is performed with Columbia University and Virginia Tech . In 2014, Georgetown received $172 million in external research grants, ranking #113 amongst all universities in the United States , for research. [ 71 ] In 2012, Georgetown spent $180 million on research, ranking it 108th nationwide. [ 72 ] In 2007, it received about $14.8 million in federal funds for research, with 64% from the National Science Foundation , National Institutes of Health , the United States Department of Energy , and the Department of Defense . [ 73 ] In 2010, the school received $5.6 million from the Department of Education to fund fellowships in several international studies fields. [ 74 ] Georgetown's Vincent Lombardi Cancer Center is one of 41 research-intensive comprehensive cancer centers in the United States, and developed the breakthrough HPV vaccine for cervical cancer [ 75 ] and Conditionally Reprogrammed Cells (CRC) technology. [ 76 ] Centers which conduct and sponsor research at Georgetown include the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs , the Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim–Christian Understanding and the Woodstock Theological Center . Regular publications include the Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy , the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal , the Georgetown Law Journal , the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs , and the Georgetown Public Policy Review . Admissions [ edit ] University rankings National ARWU [ 77 ] 103–125 Forbes [ 78 ] 23 U.S. News & World Report [ 79 ] 21 Washington Monthly [ 80 ] 109 Global ARWU [ 81 ] 301–400 QS [ 82 ] 213 Times [ 83 ] 94 Admission to Georgetown has been deemed "most selective" by U.S. News & World Report , [ 84 ] with the university receiving nearly 20,000 applications and admitting 16.4% of those that applied during the 2014–2015 admissions cycle. [ 85 ] The Fiske Guide to Colleges states that "only Stanford and a handful of Ivy League schools are tougher to get into than Georgetown." [ 86 ] As of 2011 [update] , Georgetown's graduate schools have acceptance rates of 3.6% to the School of Medicine , [ 87 ] 19% to the Law Center , [ 88 ] 25% to the MSFS , [ 89 ] and 34.9% to the MBA program . [ 90 ] In 2004, a National Bureau of Economic Research study on revealed preference of U.S. colleges showed that Georgetown was the 16th most-preferred choice. [ 91 ] The undergraduate schools maintain a restrictive Early Action admissions program, as students who have applied through an Early Decision process at another school are not permitted to apply early to Georgetown. [ 4 ] 94% of students accepted for the class of 2014 were in the top 10% of their class and had SAT scores ranging from 660–760 in Critical Reading, and 670–770 in Math. [ 92 ] Georgetown accepts both the SAT and ACT , though does not consider the writing portion of either. [ 93 ] Over 55% of undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets 100% of demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $23,500 and about 70% of aid distributed in the forms of grants or scholarships. [ 94 ] Campuses [ edit ] Main articles: Campuses of Georgetown University and List of Georgetown University buildings Georgetown University's main campus is built on a rise above the Potomac River . Georgetown University has four campuses in Washington, D.C.: the undergraduate campus, the Medical Center , the School of Continuing Studies (in Chinatown) and the Law Center. The undergraduate campus and Medical Center are together in the Georgetown neighborhood and form the main campus. Other centers are located around Washington, D.C., including the Center for Continuing and Professional Education at Clarendon in Arlington, Virginia . Transit between these locations and the Washington Metro is supplied by a system of shuttles, known as GUTS buses. [ 95 ] Georgetown also operates a facility in Doha , Qatar , and villas in Alanya , Turkey and Fiesole , Italy. In their campus layout, Georgetown's administrators consistently used the traditional quadrangle design. [ 96 ] Main campus [ edit ] Georgetown's undergraduate and medical school campuses are situated on an elevated site above the Potomac River overlooking Northern Virginia . Because of this, Georgetown University is often referred to as "The Hilltop." The main gates, known as the Healy Gates , are located at the intersection of 37th and O Streets NW, and lead directly to the heart of campus. The main campus is relatively compact, being 104 acres (0.4 km 2 ) in area, but includes fifty-four buildings, student residences and apartments capable of accommodating 80% of undergraduates, and various athletic facilities. [ 97 ] Most buildings employ collegiate Gothic architecture and Georgian brick architecture . Campus green areas include fountains, a cemetery, large clusters of flowers, groves of trees, and open quadrangles. [ 98 ] Georgetown received a B grade on the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card, and new buildings and major renovations are required to meet LEED Silver criteria. [ 99 ] Healy Hall , designed by Paul J. Pelz in Neo-Medieval style and built from 1877 to 1879, is the architectural gem of Georgetown's campus, and is a National Historic Landmark . [ 100 ] Within Healy Hall are a number of notable rooms including Gaston Hall , Riggs Library , and the Bioethics Library Hirst Reading Room. [ 101 ] Both Healy Hall and the Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory , built in 1844, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . [ 102 ] In front of the Healy and Copley Hall buildings is the large front lawn area, which is crossed by walkways and paths that center on the statue of John Carroll. In addition to the front lawn, the main campus has traditionally centered on Dahlgren Quadrangle behind Healy Hall, which is home to Dahlgren Chapel ; however, in recent decades, Red Square has replaced the Dahlgren Quadrangle as the focus of student life. [ 103 ] North of Red Square is an extended pathway that is home to buildings such as the Intercultural Center (ICC), the Reiss Science building, and the large Leavey Student Center. The northern terminus of the undergraduate campus is marked by St. Mary's Hall adjacent to Reservoir Road, home to the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. Across Reservoir Road is the Burleith neighborhood, where some upperclassmen rent houses off-campus. The medical school is located in the northwestern part of the main campus on Reservoir Road, and is integrated with Georgetown University Hospital . [ 104 ] The Medical campus includes the historic Medical-Dental Building, the Dahlgren Memorial Library, and other research and classroom facilities. In the last decade, the West side of the Hilltop has emerged as a new developing area of the main campus. The university completed the Southwest Quadrangle Project in late 2003, and brought a new 907-bed upperclassmen residence hall, the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall, an large underground parking facility, and a new Jesuit Residence to the campus. [ 105 ] The school's first performing arts center , named for Royden B. Davis , was completed in November 2005. The new business school headquarters, named for Rafik Hariri , opened in Fall 2009, and Regents Hall, the new science building, opened in the Fall of 2012. These two large buildings, along with the adjacent Leavey Student Center, have become popular study spaces, and overlook a newly developed scenic lawn space. [ 106 ] Additionally, in the fall of 2014, the university opened a new student center, the Healey Family Student Center (HFSC) to complement the longstanding Leavey Center. The Healey Family Student Center is located on the 1st floor of New South Hall , a space which had functioned as the university's main dining facility until the opening of the Leo J. O'Donovan dining hall in 2003. It features over 43,000 square feet including a number of study spaces, conference rooms, dance and music studios, as well as a pub called "Bulldog Tavern" and a salad store "Hilltoss," which is operated by The Corp . [ 107 ] The university owns many of the buildings in the Georgetown neighborhood east of the main campus and west of 35th Street NW, including all buildings west of 36th Street. This area is known as "East Campus" and is used for upperclassmen housing, classroom space, along with specific institutions, offices, and alumni facilities. Additionally, the Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences both have classroom buildings in this area. [ 104 ] Georgetown Visitation , a private Roman Catholic girls high school , is located on the northeast side of campus, on land adjoining the undergraduate campus. [ 108 ] As a location, Georgetown is ranked nationally as the second best college town by the Princeton Review . [ 109 ] The Georgetown neighborhood west of Wisconsin Avenue NW, is dominated by the presence of university students. Students have easy access to the M Street commercial area, the Georgetown Waterfront, and numerous trails that lead to the National Mall and other parks. Despite this, " town and gown " relations between the university communities and other Georgetown residents are often strained by facilities construction, enlargement of the student body, as well as noise and alcohol violations. [ 110 ] More recently, several groups of neighborhood residents have attempted to slow University growth in Georgetown, creating friction between students and the surrounding neighborhood. Despite the relative safety of the neighborhood, crime is nonetheless a persistent issue, with campus security responding to 257 crimes in 2008. [ 111 ] Law Center campus [ edit ] The Hotung International Law Center and GULC fitness center were built next to the Gewirz Student Center in 2005. The Law Center campus is located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood on New Jersey Avenue, near Union Station and consists of five buildings. First-year students at the Law Center can live in the single on-campus dormitory, the Gewirz Student Center. [ 112 ] Most second- and third-year students, as well as some first-year students, live off-campus. As there is little housing near the Law Center, most are spread throughout the Washington metropolitan area. [ 113 ] The "Campus Completion Project", finished in 2005, saw the addition of the Hotung International Building and the Sport and Fitness Center. G Street and F Street are closed off between 1st and 2nd Streets to create open lawns flanking McDonough Hall, the main building on the campus. [ 114 ] Facilities abroad [ edit ] Villa Le Balze in Fiesole, Italy hosts interdisciplinary studies. In December 1979, the Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain , granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller , gave the Villa Le Balze to Georgetown University. [ 115 ] The Villa is in Fiesole , Italy, on a hill above the city of Florence . The Villa is used year-round for study abroad programs focused on specialized interdisciplinary study of Italian culture and civilization. [ 116 ] The main facility for the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies was donated to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former United States Ambassador to Turkey George C. McGhee . [ 117 ] The school is in the town of Alanya , Turkey within the Seljuq -era Alanya Castle , on the Mediterranean. The Center operates study abroad programs one semester each year, concentrating on Turkish language , architectural history , and Islamic studies . [ 118 ] In 2002, the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development presented the School of Foreign Service with the resources and space to open a facility in the new Education City in Doha , Qatar . [ 119 ] SFS-Qatar opened in 2005 as a liberal arts and international affairs undergraduate school for regional students. [ 120 ] In December 2007, Georgetown opened a liaison office in Shanghai , China to coordinate with Fudan University and others. [ 121 ] In 2008, the Georgetown University Law Center in conjunction with an international consortium of law schools established the Center for Transnational Legal Studies in London, England. [ 122 ] Student life [ edit ] See also: Housing at Georgetown University The Georgetown undergraduate student body, at 7,636 as of 2014 [update] , is composed primarily of students from outside the District of Columbia area, with 34% of new 2010 students coming from Mid-Atlantic states , 11% being international students and the remainder coming from other areas of the US. [ 123 ] The student body also represented 129 different countries, with 11% being international , [ 124 ] including over 330 undergraduate and 1,050 graduate students who chose to come to Georgetown as a study abroad destination in 2009–10. [ 125 ] In 2014–2015, the racial diversity of the undergraduate student body was 57.0% white , 8.8% Asian , 6.2% black , and 7.5% Hispanic ; Additionally, 55.1% of undergraduates are female. [ 126 ] Students celebrate Georgetown Day in late spring with a campus carnival. Although it is a Jesuit university, only 41% of the student body identify as Roman Catholic , while 22% identify as Protestant as of 2009 [update] . [ 127 ] Georgetown employs a full-time rabbi , as 6.5% of undergraduates are Jewish . [ 127 ] It was the first U.S. college to have a full-time imam , to serve the over four-hundred Muslims on campus, [ 128 ] and in 2014, they appointed their first Hindu priest to serve a weekly community of around one hundred. [ 129 ] Georgetown also sponsors student groups for Bahá'i , Buddhist , and Mormon traditions. [ 130 ] The student body consists of both religious and non-religious students, and more than four-hundred freshmen and transfer students attend a nonreligious Ignatian retreat annually, called ESCAPE. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] A 2007 survey of undergraduates also suggests that 62.8% are sexually active, while 6.2% identify as LGBTQ . [ 127 ] [ 133 ] Discrimination can be an issue on campus, and three-fourths of a 2009 survey considered homophobia a campus problem. [ 134 ] Newsweek , however, rated Georgetown among its top "Gay-Friendly Schools" in 2010. [ 135 ] In 2011, College Magazine ranked Georgetown as the tenth most hipster U.S. college, [ 136 ] while People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals considered it the third most vegan friendly small U.S. school. [ 137 ] Almost all undergraduates attend full-time. [ 138 ] A majority of undergraduates, 76%, live on-campus in several dormitories and apartment complexes, including all underclassmen. [ 139 ] As of 2011 [update] , 1255 undergraduates and 339 graduate students live off-campus, mostly in the Georgetown , Glover Park , Burleith , and Foxhall neighborhoods. [ 140 ] Although many of the University's hall directors and area coordinators attend graduate level courses, on-campus housing is not available for main campus graduate students. [ 141 ] The school hopes to build such housing by 2020. [ 142 ] All students in the Medical School live off-campus, most in the surrounding neighborhoods, with some in Northern Virginia and elsewhere through the region. [ 143 ] Student groups [ edit ] As of 2012 [update] , 92.89% of Georgetown University undergraduates are involved in at least one of the 179 registered student organizations which cover a variety of interests: student government, club sports, media and publications, performing arts, religion, and volunteer and service. [ 144 ] Students also operate campus stores, banks, and medical services. Students often find their interests at the Student Activities Commission Club Fair, where both official and unofficial organizations set up tables. [ 145 ] The Georgetown University Student Association is the student government organization for undergraduates.

The Georgetown University College Republicans represent their party, while the Georgetown University College Democrats, the largest student organization on campus in 2008, represent theirs. [ 168 ] The reproductive rights organization H*yas for Choice is not officially recognized by the University as its positions on abortion are in opposition to University policy, prompting the asterisk in "Hoyas." [ 169 ] While not financially supported by the school, the organization is permitted to meet and table in university spaces. [ 170 ] The issue contributes to Georgetown's 'red light' status on free speech under the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education rating system. [ 171 ] In 2010, the "Plan A: Hoyas for Reproductive Justice" campaign led several protests against the school policy against the sale of birth control on campus, [ 172 ] and in 2007, Georgetown University Law Center students protested the University's decision to cease funding for a student's internship at Planned Parenthood 's litigation department despite funding it previous years.

The station was founded in 1946, and broadcast on 90.1 FM from 1960 to 1979, when university president Timothy S. Healy gave away the frequency and broadcast capabilities to the University of the District of Columbia because of WGTB's far left political orientation. The station now broadcasts through the Internet in its headquarters in the Leavey Center. [ 187 ] Greek life [ edit ] 3401 Prospect St, home to ΔΦΕ . Although Jesuit schools are not obliged to disassociate from Greek systems, many do, and Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds only one of the many Greek organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega , the national co-ed community service fraternity. Despite this, other Greek organizations exist on campus, however, none require members to live in fraternal housing. [ 188 ] Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges. [ 189 ] Active fraternities at Georgetown include Delta Phi Epsilon , a professional foreign service fraternity and sorority; Alpha Kappa Psi , a professional co-ed business fraternity; Alpha Phi Omega , a national co-ed community service fraternity; Alpha Epsilon Pi , a Jewish social fraternity; and social fraternities Sigma Phi Epsilon , Zeta Psi , and Sigma Alpha Epsilon . Delta Phi Epsilon was founded at Georgetown in 1920, and members of their Alpha Chapter include Jesuits and several deans of the School of Foreign Service . [ 190 ] The Delta Phi Epsilon foreign service sorority, founded in 1973, is the only professional sorority active at Georgetown. [ 191 ] In October 2013 the first social Greek sorority came to the Georgetown campus with the Eta Tau chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma , followed by the Theta Iota chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta in the spring of 2014. [ 192 ] [ 193 ] Georgetown's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi,was established in 2002. [ 194 ] Sigma Phi Epsilon chartered its chapter as a general social fraternity in 2007. [ 195 ] The Omega Lambda chapter of professional business fraternity Alpha Kappa Psi replaced Delta Sigma Pi , which lost its charter in 2006. [ 196 ] The Zeta Psi chapter, named Gamma Epsilon, was chartered in March 2009 after a year as a colony. [ 197 ] Events [ edit ] Annual events on campus celebrate Georgetown traditions, culture, alumni, sports, and politics. In late April, Georgetown University celebrates Georgetown Day . [ 198 ] Besides the full-day carnival, the day rewards the best professor of the year with the Dorothy Brown Award, as voted by students. Halloween is celebrated with public viewings of alumnus William Peter Blatty 's film The Exorcist , which takes place in the neighborhood surrounding the university.

Homecoming coincides with a home football game, and festivities such as tailgating and a formal dance are sponsored by the Alumni Association to draw past graduates back to campus. [ 200 ] The largest planned sports related celebration is the first basketball practice of the season. Dubbed Midnight Madness , this event introduces the men's and women's basketball teams shortly after midnight on the first day the teams are allowed by NCAA rules to formally practice together. [ 201 ] In 2013, Georgetown hosted the east regional finals round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament . [ 202 ] Georgetown University hosts notable speakers each year, largely because of the success of the Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications. [ 203 ] These are frequently important heads of state who visit Georgetown while in the capital, as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. Many prominent alumni are known to frequent the main campus. The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as Nostra aetate , Pacem in terris , and the Building Bridges Seminar. [ 204 ] Athletics [ edit ] Main article: Georgetown Hoyas Basketball stars like Roy Hibbert have led the Hoyas to seven Big East championships . Georgetown fields 23 varsity teams and the Club Sports Board supports an additional 23 club teams. The varsity teams participate in the NCAA 's Division I . The school generally competes in the Big East Conference , although the football team competes in the Division I FCS Patriot League , the sailing team in Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association , and the rowing teams in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges .

[ 205 ] Georgetown's student athletes have a 94% graduation success rate, [ 206 ] and over one-hundred have gone on to play professionally. [ 207 ] The school's teams are called "Hoyas", a name whose origin is uncertain. Sometime before 1893, students well versed in classical languages invented the mixed Greek and Latin chant of " Hoya Saxa ", translating roughly as "what (or such) rocks." The school's baseball team , then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers to one of these teams. [ 208 ] By the 1920s, the term "Hoyas" was used to describe groups on campus, and by 1928, campus sports writers started using it instead of the older team name, the "Hilltoppers." [ 209 ] [ 210 ] The name was picked up in the local publications, and became official shortly after. Jack the Bulldog has been the mascot of Georgetown athletics programs since 1962, and the school fight song is There Goes Old Georgetown . The men's basketball team is particularly noteworthy as it won the NCAA championship in 1984 under coach John Thompson . The current coach is his son, John Thompson III , who coached the team to the Final Four in the 2007 NCAA tournament . The team is tied for the most Big East conference tournament titles with seven, and has made twenty-seven NCAA tournament appearances .

[ 219 ] The men's and women's lacrosse teams have both been ranked in the top ten nationally, [ 220 ] [ 221 ] as have both soccer teams, with the men making the national championship game in 2012, [ 222 ] and the women making the national quarterfinals in 2010. [ 223 ] The rugby club team also made it to the Division II Final Four in 2005 and 2009. [ 224 ] Alumni [ edit ] Main article: List of Georgetown University alumni John J.
