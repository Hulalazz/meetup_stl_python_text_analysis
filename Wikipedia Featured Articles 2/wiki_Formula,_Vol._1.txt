It is Santos's first album as a solo artist following the breakup of American bachata group Aventura , of which he was the lead singer. The record contains fifteen tracks, most of which were composed by Santos and co-produced with Ivan Chevere. The album experiments with the sound of bachata and other genres including R&B and flamenco . It features several Anglophone and Hispanophone guest artists including Usher , Tomatito , Mario Domm , and Lil Wayne . Recording for the album took place in 2011 at The Castle, Fight Klub, and EMG Studios in New York City. A deluxe edition of the album containing five extra tracks was released exclusively in Walmart retail stores in the United States. In the U.S., Formula, Vol. 1 peaked at number one on the Billboard Top Latin Albums and Billboard Tropical Albums charts and was the best-selling Latin album of 2012. It was certified three times platinum (Latin field) by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 300,000 copies and had sold 328,000 copies in the U.S. by February 2014. It ranked number thirteen, twenty-six, and seventy-seven on the Argentine, Mexican, and Spanish album charts respectively. Santos promoted the record by touring the U.S., Latin America and Europe. It was generally well received by critics, who praised the production of the bachata tracks although some of the duets—including those with Mario Domm and Mala Rodríguez—were criticized as obvious attempts to appeal outside of the bachata audience. The album earned Santos several accolades, including a Grammy nomination, three Billboard Latin Music Awards , a Billboard Music award, a Lo Nuestro nomination, a Premios Juventud award, and a Soberano Award . Six singles were released from the record, four of which, " You ", " Promise ", " Mi Santa ", and " La Diabla ", reached number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the U.S. Contents 1 Background 2 Composition 3 Singles 4 Promotion 5 Critical reception 6 Commercial performance 7 Track listing 8 Credits and personnel 8.1 Performance credits 8.2 Technical credits 9 Charts 9.1 Weekly charts 9.2 Year-end charts 10 Certifications 11 See also 12 References Background [ edit ] Romeo Santos began his career as the lead member of Aventura , an urban bachata infused band.

[ 51 ] Critical reception [ edit ] Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating Allmusic favorable [ 10 ] Chicago Reader favorable [ 52 ] Entertainment Weekly B [ 53 ] Terra Networks [ 54 ] The Washington Post favorable [ 55 ] Thorn Jurek of Allmusic gave the album a positive review, and called "You" an "easy summertime groove" and "Promise" a "shimmering duet". [ 10 ] He also wrote that Santos's mix of genres creates "an intoxicating brew." [ 10 ] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating and wrote that Santos' "solo aspirations include cracking the R&B mainstream", and that the album "generally sticks to the successful blueprint advertised by [its] title." [ 53 ] An editor for Terra Networks gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, noting that while Santos takes risks with the sound and collaborates with other artists from different genres, the bachata tracks sound alike in the production. [ 54 ] Peter Margasak of the Chicago Reader wrote a positive review for the album, describing the album as a successful "balancing act between past and present". [ 52 ] He said the production of the album "gives everything vivid colors and gauzy textures", [ 52 ] but that some songs—including the duets "Magia Negra," with Mala Rodríguez and "Rival" with Mario Domm—were "less-than-convincing detours", describing the former as a "throbbing EDM" and the latter as "treacly power balladry". [ 52 ] Sarah Godfrey of the Washington Post gave the album a favorable review, admiring Santos for appealing to the Anglophone market without the need to "sell out bachata die-hards", citing "Promise" as the main example. [ 55 ] Godfrey said that Santos retains his style on the duet "All Aboard", and that the collaborations were "obviously meant to pull in folks who’ve never heard of Aventura". [ 55 ] She praised the compositions, including "La Diabla" and "La Bella y Bestia", which she said are "impossible to resist, whether one understands all of the lyrics or not."
