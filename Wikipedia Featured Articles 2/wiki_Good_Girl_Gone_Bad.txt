Rihanna worked with various producers on the album, including Christopher "Tricky" Stewart , Terius "Dream" Nash , Neo da Matrix , Timbaland , Carl Sturken , Evan Rogers and StarGate . Inspired by Brandy Norwood 's fourth studio album Afrodisiac (2004), Good Girl Gone Bad is a dance-pop , pop and R&B album with 1980s music influences. Described as a turning point in Rihanna's career, it represents a departure from the Caribbean sound of her previous releases, Music of the Sun (2005) and A Girl like Me (2006). Apart from the sound, she also endorsed a new image for the release going from an innocent girl to an edgier and more sexual look. Critics gave generally positive reviews of the album, praising its composition and Rihanna's new musical direction, though some criticized the record's lyrics and inconsistency. The album received seven Grammy Award nominations and one win in the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration category for " Umbrella " at the 2008 ceremony . The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and sold 162,000 copies in its first week. Certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it sold more than 2.8 million copies in the United States. The album reached number one in Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and it has sold over 7 million copies worldwide. Good Girl Gone Bad spawned five singles, including the international hits "Umbrella" and " Don't Stop the Music "; Rolling Stone placed the former at number 412 on the magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. In support of the album, Rihanna embarked on her first worldwide concert tour, the Good Girl Gone Bad Tour . The album was reissued as Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded in June 2008 with three new songs, including the Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits " Take a Bow " and " Disturbia ". It was followed by Rihanna's first remix album, Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes , in January 2009, which featured remixes from Moto Blanco , Tony Moran , the Soul Seekerz and the Wideboys .

I didn't consult with anybody. I just want to have a little more fun with my music and be a little more experimental in terms of my image and my sound. I just reinvented myself. “ ” —Rihanna talking to The StarPhoenix about the style she took for the album [ 1 ] Rihanna 's second studio album, A Girl like Me , was released in April 2006. It is a pop -oriented record [ 2 ] with dancehall and R&B influences. [ 3 ] It had a mixed critical reception: some critics praised Rihanna's new musical direction, [ 4 ] while others criticized some of the album's songs. [ 5 ] Around its time of release, many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of American singer Beyoncé . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The album sold over 587,308 copies in the United Kingdom [ 8 ] and more than 1,330,000 copies in the United States. [ 9 ] In early 2007, Rihanna began work on her third studio album. [ 10 ] In an interview with MTV News , she announced that "the new music is going in a different direction. Not on purpose, but I just want to hear something fresh and mostly uptempo. I think that's where I want to go on this one. You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo [songs]." [ 10 ] The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress Charlize Theron 's bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller Æon Flux . [ 11 ] Rihanna explained that she wanted to keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. [ 10 ] She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood , as her main inspiration for the album. [ 12 ] In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." [ 13 ] Recording and production [ edit ] Ne-Yo co-wrote and provided vocals on " Hate That I Love You ". Producer Christopher "Tricky" Stewart co-wrote and co-produced the lead single from the album, " Umbrella ". Good Girl Gone Bad was recorded in Westlake Recording Studios and Conway Studios in Los Angeles, Battery Studios and Roc the Mic Studios in New York City, Chicago Recording Company and Pressure Studios in Chicago, Phase One Audio Group in Toronto, Lethal Studios in Bridgetown, Barbados , Espionage Studios in Oslo and Parr Street Studios in Liverpool . [ 14 ] Rihanna spent the week of the 2007 Grammy Awards working with American R&B singer-songwriter Ne-Yo , who gave her vocal lessons. [ 10 ] They wrote and sang " Hate That I Love You ", which was co-written and produced by Norwegian duo StarGate . [ 15 ] Ne-Yo told Vibe magazine, "The best way to express an emotion like love is through storytelling. It makes it more 'I can relate to this character in this song, because I've been through something similar.' You hear that kind of storytelling in the song that I wrote for Rihanna called 'Hate That I Love You'." [ 16 ] American producers Tricky Stewart and Dream had written the track " Umbrella " in 2007 with pop singer Britney Spears in mind. Her label rejected the song before she could hear it, stating they had enough songs for her to record; at the time, Spears was working on her fifth studio album Blackout . [ 17 ] The producers then reached out to Mary J. Blige , who did not have time to consider the song for her next album. [ 17 ] Finally, L.A. Reid , then-CEO of Def Jam Recordings , bought the record and forwarded it to Rihanna. Initially, Stewart was unsure whether Rihanna was the right artist for the song, but after they had recorded the "ella, ella" catch phrase for the track, he felt optimistic. [ 17 ] Rapper Jay-Z added rap vocals. [ 17 ] Stewart also co-wrote and produced "Breakin' Dishes" with Nash. [ 15 ] " Rehab ", "Sell Me Candy", and "Lemme Get That" were composed and produced by Timbaland for the album. [ 12 ] [ 15 ] He was on the FutureSex/LoveShow concert tour with Justin Timberlake to promote Timberlake's 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds . After a show in Chicago, they joined Rihanna in the studio, where Timberlake experimented with beats and melodies. [ 12 ] Weeks later, the three met in New York City, where Timberlake had conceptualized a song for Rihanna. Timbaland, who penned a song for Rihanna under the title "Rehab", was producing a beat, over which Timberlake improvised his lyrics. [ 12 ] Hannon Lane also co-wrote and co-produced the song. [ 18 ] Timberlake told Entertainment Weekly that he believed "Rehab" to be "the bridge for [Rihanna] to be accepted as an adult in the music industry". [ 19 ] Rihanna told Robert Copsey of Digital Spy that she enjoyed working with Timberlake, and learned much from the sessions. [ 20 ] Composition [ edit ] A dance-pop [ 21 ] and pop/R&B album [ 22 ] influenced by 1980s music , [ 12 ] Good Girl Gone Bad is a departure from the Caribbean sound of Rihanna's previous two records. [ 23 ] Lyrically, the album is close to some teen pop records, "where sexual-ism and consumerism supersede personal connection."

[ 23 ] The collaboration with Ne-Yo, "Hate That I Love You", is a folky R&B song; Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared it to Ne-Yo's singles " Sexy Love " and " Because of You ".

[ 26 ] "Rehab" is an old-styled R&B track with a groove that is built around tambourine shakes, acoustic guitar swirls and a subtle backbeat. Doug Rule of Metro Weekly noted similarities among the structures of "Rehab" and Timberlake's 2002 single " Cry Me a River ". [ 32 ] "Question Existing" is an "eerie, smoky, destitute, emotional, and a sonic sidestep." [ 33 ] Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media described the opening lyrics of the song as inspired by "puerile psuedoporn". [ 24 ] The album concludes with the title track "Good Girl Gone Bad", which is played with an acoustic guitar and click tracks .

[ 95 ] [ 96 ] Critical response [ edit ] Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating About.com [ 97 ] AllMusic [ 23 ] Blender [ 98 ] Entertainment Weekly B+ [ 99 ] The Guardian [ 100 ] Hot Press 2.5/5 [ 28 ] The Observer [ 29 ] Pitchfork Media 7.4/10 [ 24 ] Slant Magazine [ 37 ] Uncut [ 101 ] Good Girl Gone Bad received generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews. [ 102 ] Uncut called it a "shiny, trans-atlantic blend of Europop vim, R&B grit and Caribbean bounce." [ 101 ] Andy Kellman of AllMusic deemed it quintessential pop music and said each of its tracks was a potential hit. [ 23 ] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, describing it as "more raw, perhaps edgier and more risqué" than Rihanna's previous material. [ 53 ] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that the album "sounds as if it were scientifically engineered to deliver hits". [ 103 ] Peter Robinson of The Observer commended her collaborators for "masking her own shortcomings" and commented that, "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." [ 29 ] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying. [ 24 ] Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly felt that, although it "goes bad when Rihanna tries her hand at treacly ballads and glum sentiment", at times Good Girl Gone Bad is a "thrilling throwback to more than a decade ago, when upstart producers haphazardly mashed R&B with hip-hop to create chunky jeep anthems such as Mary J. Blige's ' Real Love '." [ 99 ] In a mixed review, Rodney Dugue of The Village Voice felt that the album "never settles on a sound" and only cited its three Timbaland-produced songs as highlights. [ 45 ] Although he found the ballads to be improvements from Rihanna's previous albums, Slant Magazine ' s Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrics, particularly those written by Justin Timberlake, as an "Achilles' high heel for Rihanna". [ 37 ] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian found Rihanna to be "ill-suited" for its dance-pop songs and stated, "The gimmicky samples and pounding beats bury her personality, and the summery reggae of her first two albums is sorely missed." [ 100 ] Robert Christgau of MSN Music cited "Umbrella" as a "choice cut", [ 104 ] indicating "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". [ 105 ] Commercial performance [ edit ] In the United States, Good Girl Gone Bad debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 162,000 copies in its first week. It became Rihanna's then-best start album entry. [ 106 ] The next week, it fell to number seven with 81,000 copies sold. [ 107 ] The re-issue sold 63,000 copies in the first week and helped Good Girl Gone Bad jump from number 124 to number seven on the US Billboard 200 in its 55th week.

[ 122 ] By November 2009, Good Girl Gone Bad had sold over 7 million copies worldwide. [ 123 ] Impact [ edit ] According to Biography.com , Good Girl Gone Bad inspired Rihanna to transform her image from a "teen pop princess" persona into a "fully fledged superstar and sex symbol". [ 124 ] People magazine noted that Rihanna follows the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera "when she sheds her innocent image for an edgier look and sound". [ 125 ] Jay-Z also spoke about "Umbrella" and stated that the song represents an artistic grow for Rihanna, "If you listen to the lyrics to that song, you know the depth and how far she's come." [ 124 ] Regarding the commercial impact of the album, Entertainment Weekly' s Margeaux Watson wrote, "For a pop star who was once dismissed as being incapable of yielding more than one hit song per album, Rihanna's newfound staying power is nothing short of remarkable–and proof that there’s room for more than one diva in this game." [ 126 ] Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic concluded that it was Good Girl Gone Bad that made Rihanna a "full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts". [ 127 ] Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the album, as the closest thing to a Thriller that 2007/08 is likely to produce.

Following its digital release, the song debuted atop the Hot Digital Songs chart, with first-week sales of more than 277,000 units. The single became the highest digital debut in the United States since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking downloads in 2003, surpassing Timberlake's " SexyBack " 250,000 sales record in 2006.
