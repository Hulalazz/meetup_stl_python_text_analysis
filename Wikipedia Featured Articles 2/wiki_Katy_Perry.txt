[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Her parents are born again Christians , each having turned to God after a "wild youth". [ 3 ] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry. [ 4 ] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry . [ 5 ] She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer, [ 6 ] and an older sister, Angela. [ 7 ] From ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years . [ 2 ] [ 8 ] Her family struggled financially, [ 9 ] sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church. [ 10 ] Growing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat Lucky Charms as the term "luck" reminded their mother of Lucifer , and had to call deviled eggs "angeled eggs". [ 11 ] Perry primarily listened to gospel music , [ 12 ] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. [ 13 ] While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, "I pray all the time – for self-control, for humility." [ 14 ] Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9, [ 15 ] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, [ 3 ] singing in church from ages 9 to 17. [ 16 ] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, [ 3 ] [ 17 ] and publicly performed songs she wrote. [ 9 ] She tried to "be a bit like the typical Californian girl" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence. [ 18 ] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing , Lindy Hop , and jitterbug . [ 19 ] 1999–2006: Career beginnings During her freshman year of high school, [ 20 ] Perry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15, and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied Italian opera at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee , who brought her there to improve her writing skills. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar. [ 12 ] After signing with Red Hill Records , Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson . She released the album on March 6, 2001, [ 23 ] and went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel 's Strangely Normal Tour.

[ 29 ] In 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group . She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped. [ 30 ] Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine , an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child , Greg Wells , Butch Walker , Scott Cutler/Anne Previn, The Matrix , Kara DioGuardi , and Max Martin and Dr. Luke . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In addition, after Devine suggested they become a "real group", she recorded with the Matrix . [ 33 ] Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After she was dropped from Columbia, Perry worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music . [ 34 ] Perry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, "Simple", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . [ 35 ] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger 's song " Old Habits Die Hard ", [ 36 ] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie .

's single " Goodbye for Now " and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006.

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs " I Kissed a Girl " and " Hot n Cold " for her second album One of the Boys . A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to " Ur So Gay ", aimed at introducing her to the music market. [ 41 ] A digital EP led by "Ur So Gay" was later released to create interest. [ 3 ] [ 42 ] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising the track on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008, [ 43 ] stating it was her "favorite song". [ 44 ] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode "Life's Too Short", [ 45 ] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot in June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style .

The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiousity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success. [ 72 ] After her relationship with McCoy ended in December 2008, [ 73 ] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek .

[ 190 ] At the age of 15, she heard Queen 's " Killer Queen " and has described it as being the song that inspired her to pursue a career in music. [ 191 ] She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury , as her biggest influence and expressed how the "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" inspired her music. [ 192 ] She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. [ 180 ] Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: "[It] is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting.

She names Gwen Stefani and Björk as influences, particularly admiring Björk's "willingness to always be taking chances". [ 195 ] "Firework" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe. [ 198 ] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz . [ 199 ] She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for being the influence behind her song "Dark Horse", [ 200 ] and Eckhart Tolle 's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism . [ 136 ] Musical style and themes "When I am in between records, sometimes I doubt myself. I'll be like: Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position? And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes." —Perry on her confidence as a songwriter [ 201 ] While Perry's music incorporates pop , rock , and disco , Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream , involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences. [ 202 ] [ 203 ] Perry's fourth album, Prism , is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. [ 204 ] Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream , reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as "irresistible hook-laden melodies". [ 28 ] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music. [ 205 ] Perry identifies as a " singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star" [ 206 ] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire : "I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." [ 14 ] Kristen Wiig commented that "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record." [ 194 ] According to Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune , "being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet." [ 207 ] The New York Times labeled her "the most potent pop star of the day – her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation". [ 208 ] Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent "clichés". [ 209 ] Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene , [ 210 ] [ 211 ] Jessie James , [ 212 ] Kelly Clarkson , [ 213 ] Lesley Roy , [ 214 ] Britney Spears , [ 215 ] Iggy Azalea , [ 216 ] and Nicki Minaj . [ 217 ] Perry has a contralto vocal range. [ 218 ] [ 219 ] Her singing has received both praise and criticism, Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her "powerful voice is hard-edged" [ 220 ] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as "processed staccato blips". [ 203 ] Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a "perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable". [ 221 ] Alex Miller from NME felt that "Perry's problem is often her voice" on One of the Boys , stating that "somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick". [ 222 ] Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her "rock chick voice" in a review of a concert promoting Prism . [ 223 ] Public image Perry's trademark spinning peppermint swirl dress Perry is considered a sex symbol ; GQ labelled her a "full-on male fantasy", [ 9 ] while Elle described her body "as though sketched by a teenage boy". [ 20 ] Vice described her as a "'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol". [ 224 ] She was placed at number one on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2010 as the "most beautiful woman in the world", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a "triple – no quadruple – kind of hot". [ 225 ] Men's Health readers voted her the "sexiest woman of 2013". [ 226 ] In November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar that she was proud of and satisfied with her figure. [ 227 ] Perry's fashion often incorporates humor, bright colors, and food-related themes [ 228 ] such as her trademark spinning peppermint swirl dress. [ 229 ] Vogue described her as "never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm", [ 230 ] while Glamour named her the "queen of quirk". [ 231 ] In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was "a bit of a concoction of different things" and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing. [ 232 ] She has also described herself as having " multipersonality disorder " for fashion. [ 227 ] Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson , Chloë Sevigny , Daphne Guinness , Natalie Portman , and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons. [ 28 ] [ 233 ] On social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013. [ 234 ] She won the 2015 Guinness World Record for most Twitter followers, [ 235 ] and became the first person to gain 80 million followers on the site in January 2016. [ 236 ] Forbes writer Dorothy Pomerantz commended Perry on her social media usage, saying "Perry makes excellent use of Twitter, talking to her fans and sharing funny photos and videos in a way that makes them all feel like Perry is their best buddy." [ 237 ] Keith Caulfield of Billboard stated that she is "the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats." [ 238 ] Other ventures Philanthropy Perry became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in December 2013 Perry has supported various charitable organizations and causes during her career. She has contributed to organizations aimed at improving the lives and welfare of children in particular.

All profits from sales of the album were donated to the charity Little Kids Rock , which supports musical education in underprivileged elementary schools. [ 168 ] In June 2014, she teamed up with Staples Inc. for a project entitled "Make Roar Happen" which donated $1 million to DonorsChoose , an organization that supports teachers and funds classroom resources in public schools.

The concert's profits were donated to Young Survival Coalition , an organization aiding breast cancer in young women. [ 245 ] In June 2009, she designed an item of clothing for H&M 's "Fashion Against AIDS" campaign, which raises money for HIV/AIDS awareness projects. [ 246 ] The proceeds from Perry's single "Part of Me" were donated to the charity MusiCares , which helps musicians in times of need.

The money was divided between three charities: the Children's Health Fund (CHF), Generosity Water, and The Humane Society of the United States .

[ 251 ] Politics Perry is a gay rights activist. She supported Stonewall during their "It gets better..... today" campaign to prevent homophobic bullying, [ 252 ] and dedicated the music video to her song "Firework" to the It Gets Better Project . [ 253 ] Perry told Do Something in November 2008 she was proud to be a gay activist, saying "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8 , an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman in California . [ 254 ] In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future." [ 255 ] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth. [ 256 ] She identifies as a feminist , [ 257 ] and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the "Chime For Change" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.
