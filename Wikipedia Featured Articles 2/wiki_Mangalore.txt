It is known as Kudla in Tulu , Mangaluru in Kannada , Maikāla in Beary , Kodial in Canarese Konkani and Mangalapuram in Malayalam. It is located about 371 kilometres (230 mi) west of the state capital, Bangalore . Mangalore lies between the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghat mountain ranges, and is the administrative headquarters of the Dakshina Kannada (formerly South Canara ) district in south western Karnataka. With its pristine beaches, broad roads and calm localities, Mangalore was ranked the 8th cleanest city of India and 2nd of Karnataka. [ 8 ] Mangalore is the 2nd least polluted city in India and the 1st in Karnataka according to CPCB . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Mangalore was ranked India's 13th and Karnataka's 2nd best destination for business. [ 11 ] It developed as a port on the Arabian Sea —remaining, to this day, a major port of India. Lying on the backwaters of the Netravati and Gurupura rivers, Mangalore is often used as a staging point for sea traffic along the Malabar Coast . The city has a tropical climate and lies in the path of the Arabian Sea branch of the South-West monsoons . Mangalore's port handles 75 per cent of India's coffee and cashew exports. [ 12 ] Mangalore was ruled by several major powers, including the Kadambas , Alupas , Vijayanagar Empire , Keladi Nayaks , and the Portuguese . The city was a source of contention between the British and the Mysore rulers, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan . Eventually annexed by the British in 1799, Mangalore remained part of the Madras Presidency until India's independence in 1947. The city was unified with the state of Mysore (now called Karnataka ) in 1956. [ 13 ] Mangalore is demographically diverse with several languages, including Tulu , Canarese Konkani , Kannada , English , Urdu , and Beary commonly spoken, and is the largest city in Dakshina Kannada district. Mangalore is one of the most cosmopolitan non-metro cities of India. It is also the largest city in the Coastal and Malnad regions of Karnataka, besides being a leading commercial, industrial, educational and healthcare hub on the West Coast. Mangalore city urban agglomeration extends from Ullal in the south to Surathkal in the north, covering a distance of over 35 km.The city's landscape is characterised by rolling hills, coconut palms, freshwater streams and hard red-clay tiled-roof buildings. [ 14 ] Mangalore has been selected as one of the hundred Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under PM Narendra Modi's flagship Smart Cities Mission .

[ 17 ] According to local legend, a princess from Malabar named Parimala or Premaladevi renounced her kingdom and became a disciple of Matsyendranath , the founder of the Nath tradition. Having converted Premaladevi to the Nath sect, Matsyendranath renamed her Mangaladevi . She arrived in the area with Matsyendranath, but had to settle near Bolar in Mangalore as she fell ill on the way. Eventually she died, and the Mangaladevi temple was consecrated in her honour at Bolar by the local people after her death. [ 18 ] The city got its name from the temple. [ 19 ] One of the earliest references to the city's name was made in 715 CE by the Pandyan King Chettian, who called the city Mangalapuram . [ 20 ] According to K.V. Ramesh, President of the Place Names Society of India, Mangaluru was first heard in 1345 CE during the Vijayanagar rule. Many shilashasanas (stones) of Vijayanagar period refer the city as Mangalapura . Even before that, during the Alupas period, it was referred to as Mangalapura ('Mangala' means 'auspicious'). The city is well known as Mangaluru in Kannada, a reference to Mangaladevi (the suffix uru means town or city). During the British occupation from 1799, Mangalore (anglicised from Mangaluru ), stuck as the official appellation. [ 21 ] However, according to historian George M. Moraes, the word "Mangalore" is the Portuguese corruption of Mangaluru . [ 22 ] :2 The name of this town also appears in maps as early as the 1652 Sanson Map of India. [ 23 ] Mangalore's diverse communities have different names for the city in their languages. In Tulu, the primary spoken language, the city is called Kuḍla , meaning "junction", since the city is situated at the confluence of the Netravati and Gurupura rivers. In Canarese Konkani , Mangalore is referred to as Koḍiyāḷ , while the Beary name for the city is Maikala. [ 24 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Mangalore Mangalore's historical importance is highlighted by the many references to the city by foreign travellers. During the first century CE, Pliny the Elder , a Roman historian, made references to a place called Nitrias , as a very undesirable place for disembarkation, on account of the pirates which frequent its vicinity, [ 25 ] while Greek historian Ptolemy in the second century CE referred to a place called Nitra . Ptolemy's and Pliny the Elder's references were probably made to the Netravati River, which flows through Mangalore. [ 26 ] Cosmas Indicopleustes , a Greek monk, in his 6th century work Christian Topography mentions Malabar as the chief seat of the pepper trade, and Mangarouth (port of Mangalore) as one of the five pepper marts which exported pepper. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The Sultan Battery in Mangalore, built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to defend the city from British warships entering the Gurupura river [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Mangalore is the heart of a distinct multilinguistic—cultural region: Tulu Nadu , the homeland of the Tulu-speaking people, which was nearly coterminous with the modern district of South Canara . [ 31 ] In the third century BCE, the town formed part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka of Magadha . [ 32 ] :176 From the third century CE to sixth century CE, the Kadamba dynasty , whose capital was based in Banavasi in North Canara , ruled over the entire Canara region as independent rulers. [ 33 ] From the middle of the seventh century to the end of the 14th century, the South Canara region was ruled by its own native Alupa rulers. The Alupas ruled over the region as feudatories of major regional dynasties like the Chalukyas of Badami , Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta , Chalukyas of Kalyani , and Hoysalas of Dwarasamudra . [ 34 ] :17 During the reign of the Alupa king Kavi Alupendra (c. 1110 – c.1160), the city was visited by the Tunisian Jewish merchant Abraham Ben Yiju, who travelled between the Middle East and India during the 12th century. [ 35 ] The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta , who had visited the town in 1342, referred to it as Manjarur , and stated that the town was situated on a large estuary , called the "estuary of the wolf," and was the greatest estuary in the country of Malabar. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] :30 By 1345, the Vijayanagara rulers brought the region under their control. [ 34 ] :17 During the Vijayanagara period (1345–1550), South Canara was divided into Mangalore and Barkur rajyas (provinces), and two governors were appointed to look after each of them from Mangalore and Barkur . But many times only one governor ruled over both Mangalore and Barkur rajyas , and when the authority passed into the hands of Keladi rulers (c. 1550–1763), they had a governor at Barkur alone. [ 34 ] :19 In 1448, Abdur Razzaq , the Persian ambassador of Sultan Shah Rukh of Samarkand , visited Mangalore, en route to the Vijayanagara court. [ 37 ] :31 The Italian traveler, Ludovico di Varthema , who visited India in 1506 says that he witnessed nearly sixty ships laden with rice ready for sail in the port of Mangalore. [ 34 ] :20 European influence in Mangalore can be traced back to 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary's Island near Mangalore. [ 38 ] In the 16th century, the Portuguese came to acquire substantial commercial interests in Canara. Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529), the then ruler of the Vijaynagara empire maintained friendly relations with the Portuguese. The Portuguese trade was gradually gathering momentum and they were striving to destroy the Arab and Moplah trade along the coast. In 1524, when Vasco da Gama heard that the Muslim merchants of Calicut had agents at Mangalore and Basrur , he ordered the rivers to be blockaded. In 1526, the Portuguese under the viceroyship of Lopo Vaz de Sampaio took possession of Mangalore. The coastal trade passed out of Muslim hands into Portuguese hands. [ 34 ] :20 In 1550, the Vijayanagara ruler, Sadashiva Raya , entrusted the work of administering the coastal region of Canara to Sadashiv Nayaka of Keladi . By 1554, he was able to establish political authority over South Canara. The disintegration of the Vijaynagara Empire in 1565 gave the rulers of Keladi greater power in dealing with the coastal Canara region. [ 34 ] :27 They continued the Vijayanagara administrative system. The two provinces of Mangalore and Barkur continued to exist. The Governor of Mangalore also acted as the Governor of the Keladi army in his province. [ 34 ] :30 In 1695, the town was torched by Arabs in retaliation to Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade. [ 39 ] A pen and ink drawing of Mangalore Fort made in 1783, after it had been taken by the English East India Company Hyder Ali , the de facto ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore , conquered Mangalore in 1763, [ 40 ] consequently bringing the city under his administration until 1767. Mangalore was ruled by the British East India Company from 1767 to 1783, [ 41 ] but was subsequently wrested from their control in 1783 by Hyder Ali's son, Tipu Sultan; who renamed it Jalalabad . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] The Second Anglo–Mysore War ended with the Treaty of Mangalore , signed between Tipu Sultan and the British East India Company on 11 March 1784. [ 44 ] After the defeat of Tipu at the Fourth Anglo–Mysore War , the city remained in control of the British, headquartering the Canara district under the Madras Presidency. [ 21 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] According to the Scottish physician Francis Buchanan who visited Mangalore in 1801, Mangalore was a rich and prosperous port with flourishing trading activity. [ 47 ] Rice was the grand article of export, and was exported to Muscat , Bombay , Goa and Malabar . Supari or Betel-nut was exported to Bombay, Surat and Kutch . Pepper and Sandalwood were exported to Bombay. Turmeric was exported to Muscat, Kutch, Surat and Bombay, along with Cassia Cinnamon , Sugar , Iron , Saltpeter , Ginger , Coir and Timber . [ 47 ] The Light House Hill tower in Light House Hill , Hampankatta , served as a watchtower for the British Navy. [ 48 ] The British colonial government did not support industrialisation in the region, and local capital remained invested mostly in land and money lending, which led to the later development of banking in the region. With the arrival of European missionaries in the early 19th century, the region saw the development of educational institutions and a modern industrial base, modeled on European industries. The opening of the Lutheran Swiss Basel Mission in 1834 was central to the industrialisation process. Printing press, cloth-weaving mills and tile factories manufacturing the famed Mangalore tiles were set up by the missionaries. [ 31 ] When Canara (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was bifurcated into North Canara and South Canara in 1859, Mangalore was transferred into South Canara and became its headquarters. [ 49 ] :5 South Canara remained under Madras Presidency, while North Canara was detached from Madras Presidency and transferred to Bombay Presidency in 1862. [ 49 ] :6 The enactment of the Madras Town Improvement Act (1865) mandated the establishment of the Municipal council on 23 May 1866, which was responsible for urban planning and providing civic amenities. [ 22 ] :178 The Italian Jesuits , who arrived in Mangalore in 1878, played an important role in education, economy, health, and social welfare of the city. [ 50 ] The linking of Mangalore in 1907 to the Southern Railway , and the subsequent proliferation of motor vehicles in India, further increased trade and communication between the city and the rest of the country. [ 51 ] By the early 20th century, Mangalore had become a major supplier of educated manpower to Bombay , Bangalore , and the Middle East . [ 31 ] As a result of the States Reorganisation Act (1956), Mangalore (part of the Madras Presidency until this time) was incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Mysore State (now called Karnataka ). [ 13 ] [ 52 ] :415 Mangalore is the sixth largest city of Karnataka, and ninth largest port of India, providing the state with access to the Arabian Sea coastline. [ 31 ] Mangalore experienced significant growth in the decades 1970–80, with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] Today, the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with a flourishing service sector, particularly in medical services, a small but growing IT regional hub, and a booming real estate and banking industry.
