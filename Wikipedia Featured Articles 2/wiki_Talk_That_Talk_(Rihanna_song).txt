Before her sixth studio album Talk That Talk was released in November 2011, Rihanna announced on her Twitter account that, apart from the song " We Found Love " with Calvin Harris , the album would have only one other featured artist, although she did not mention the artist's name. [ 1 ] Jay Brown, Rihanna's manager, explained that they preferred to record independently rather than collaborate with other artists. [ 2 ] On November 8, Rihanna confirmed on Twitter that her mentor, American rapper Jay-Z , would appear as a featured artist on the album's title track. [ 3 ] Brown said that the collaboration "happened organically". [ 4 ] "Talk That Talk" is the third major collaboration between Rihanna and Jay-Z, who had worked together on " Umbrella " in 2007 and " Run This Town " in 2009. [ 3 ] "Umbrella" was the lead single from Rihanna's 2007 album Good Girl Gone Bad and topped the charts in more than ten countries, including the US Billboard Hot 100 , on which it spent seven consecutive weeks at number one. [ 5 ] "Run This Town", which also featured rapper Kanye West , was released as the second single from Jay-Z's 2009 album The Blueprint 3 . [ 6 ] Production and release [ edit ] "Talk That Talk" was written by Ester Dean , Jay-Z, StarGate , Anthony Best , Sean Combs , and Chucky Thompson , and produced by StarGate. [ 7 ] They had produced Rihanna's 2010 hit singles " Only Girl (In the World) " and " What's My Name? " for her fifth album Loud . [ 8 ] StarGate told Norwegian website 730.no that it was their first collaboration with Jay-Z and said that they were very satisfied with both the song and each artist's contribution. [ 1 ] "Talk That Talk" was recorded at Roc the Mic Studios and The Jungle City Studios in New York City, Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and The Hide Out Studios in London. StarGate, Miles Walker, and Mike Anderson served as the song's recording engineers . Rihanna's vocals were recorded by Marcos Tovar and Kuk Harrell , who additionally produced them, while Jordan "DJ Swivel" Young recorded Jay-Z's verses. Additional recording of the song was done in Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg and Savoy London hotels. "Talk That Talk" was mixed by Phil Tan and assistant Daniela Rivera at Ninja Beat Club Studios in Atlanta . Eriksen and Hermansen recorded the song's instrumentation, and Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. were assigned as its executive producers . [ 7 ] In December 2011, Rihanna asked her fans on Twitter to recommend a song from Talk That Talk for release as the third single. [ 9 ] On January 10, 2012, she announced that the title track was chosen [ 10 ] and also debuted the single's cover—a black-and-white image in which Rihanna is dressed in "street punk/rockabilly clothes" and crouches against a wall. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] According to Jazmine Gray of Vibe magazine, the singer's has an ambiguous facial expression on the cover. [ 12 ] On January 17, Def Jam Recordings serviced "Talk That Talk" to urban contemporary radio stations in the United States.

Problems playing this file? See media help . "Talk That Talk" has a length of three minutes and twenty-nine seconds. [ 17 ] Time magazine's Claire Suddath characterized it as a lively hip hop track with a pop hook . [ 18 ] It features R&B beats , [ 19 ] "hard drums", unrefined synths , [ 1 ] and a sample of the song "I Got a Story to Tell" by rapper The Notorious B.I.G. . [ 2 ] Adrian Thrills from the Daily Mail described the song as "slow and sultry". [ 20 ] Similarly, Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy found it sensual and confident, and observed that Rihanna counts when she sings the song's chorus . [ 21 ] IGN 's Chad Grischow wrote that a "fuzzy synth melody" interjects Rihanna's "sexy plea for pillow talk", which is complemented by "bling-loving rap from Jay-Z." [ 22 ] Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey felt that its riff is similar to Rihanna's 2010 single " Rude Boy ". [ 23 ] The song begins with a rap verse performed by Jay Z, whose lines include: "I talk big money, I talk big homes / I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome / Million dollar voice, came through phone / We heading to the top, if you coming, come on". [ 24 ] He raps at a slow pace and incorporates both double entendres and humorous remarks, including a sexual reference that Claire Suddath viewed was an indication of Jay Z's enjoyment on the song: "[I] had it by her bladder, she's like 'Oh I gotta pee!'." [ 18 ] Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly remarked that he "even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can fly out to Pisa / Just to get some pizza." [ 25 ] Critical reception [ edit ] "Talk That Talk" was well received by most music critics . Daily Mirror critic Gavin Martin commented that the song has Rihanna "stealing not just Beyoncé 's bootylicious crown but also her husband Jay Z for a frisky exchange against sibilant drum cracks." [ 26 ] Sputnikmusic 's Steve M. felt that it could be a major hit on radio partly because of Jay Z's guest rap. [ 27 ] Reem Buhazza of The National similarly felt that "Talk That Talk", along with " You da One " and " Roc Me Out ", is part of "the winning combination of made-for-radio pop sensibility". [ 28 ] David Griffiths from 4Music found the song to be compelling and viewed it as another successful collaboration between Rihanna and Jay-Z. [ 29 ] Lansky from MTV Buzzworthy was not surprised that another collaboration between the two was a success. [ 21 ] MTV News ' Jocelyn Vena called it "big and hard with just enough brightness" and felt that the song discusses sexual intercourse more appropriately than " Cockiness (Love It) "; [ 30 ] in the latter, Rihanna expresses her desire to have sex while singing the lyrics "Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion". [ 31 ] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars and called it an enticing, anthemic club song. [ 19 ] In a review of Talk That Talk , Pitchfork Media 's Lindsay Zoladz wrote that it is one of the album's more lighthearted songs, even though it is not as good as "Umbrella". [ 32 ] Consequence of Sound 's Chris Coplan found Jay Z's rap unenthusiastic, but said that Rihanna is as emotional and invested in her singing as she was on Saturday Night Live . [ 33 ] People magazine's Chuck Arnold called the song "another moment in the sun." [ 34 ] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin thought that it is a collaboration that "does not go unnoticed". [ 35 ] On the critical side, Priya Elan of NME wrote that the song is a "gamble that doesn’t pay off". [ 36 ] The single was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2013 Grammy Awards , [ 37 ] but lost to " No Church in the Wild " (2012) by Jay-Z and Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean and The-Dream .
