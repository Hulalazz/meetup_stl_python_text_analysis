"Diamonds" is a mid-tempo electronic and pop ballad that features heavy synthesizers , orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms. The song's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna's previous singles and contain a prominent concept of love. "Diamonds" was well received by most critics , some of whom complimented Rihanna's different musical direction, while others criticized the song's production. The single topped music charts in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and tied her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fifth-most number one singles in the chart's history.

The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013 and 2014.

In 2012, American songwriter and record producer Benny Blanco met with Norwegian production duo StarGate at a recording studio in New York City to write new songs, including one for Rihanna. [ 1 ] StarGate had previously produced her singles " Don't Stop the Music " (2007) and " Only Girl (In the World) " (2010). [ 2 ] According to Blanco, he and StarGate wanted to deviate from Rihanna's usual sound and produce as though the song would be for a rapper such as Kanye West : "It's the one that we weren't thinking Rihanna ... that turned into the Rihanna record ... But that's how it always happens like with me". [ 1 ] They produced the song's drum machine beat after the other instrumental music was recorded. [ 1 ] StarGate's Mikkel S. Eriksen told The New York Times that Blanco took a recorded snippet of Eriksen's singing, altered it electronically, and made it sound "dirtier". [ 3 ] He then applied timbre and used audio software to create ghostly accompaniment lines. Eriksen described Blanco's style as "unorthodox, as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters them to the right pitch to go with the song." [ 3 ] Australian singer-songwriter Sia later joined them and wrote the lyrics for "Diamonds" in 14 minutes. [ 1 ] [ 4 ] After the song was completed, they wanted to play it to Rihanna, but Blanco was skeptical about the reaction towards the song because of its slow sound. After StarGate played it to her, they called Blanco from London and told him that she liked the song: "She's flippin' out. She played it like seven times in a row. It's her favorite song." [ 1 ] Phil Tan and the assistant Daniela Rivera, mixed and mastered "Diamonds". [ 5 ] Recalling it, in an interview with The Huffington Post , Blanco commented, "we needed to have it recorded, the beat finished, mixed and mastered in 24 hours. She was recording in a separate part of the world, sending back the files, we're finishing the music and then we're mixing and mastering it, and then it was out in a few days. It's fucking amazing and incredible." [ 6 ] Kuk Harrell produced Rihanna's vocals on the song and recorded them together with Marcos Tovar. [ 5 ] Release and artwork "I think a lot of people are afraid of being happy because of what others might think of it. ... They're afraid to embrace that and embrace themselves and love themselves and do what they love and do what makes them happy." —Rihanna talking about the lyrical meaning behind "Diamonds" for MTV News . [ 7 ] On September 12, 2012, Def Jam France announced via Twitter that Rihanna would release a new single the following week and that her seventh studio album will be released in November. However, the tweet was shortly deleted and replaced with another clarifying that more information will be given on September 13. [ 8 ] In an interview with iHeartRadio at their annual music festival in September, Rihanna confirmed "Diamonds" as her new single and said that it would first be played on American radio beginning September 26. [ 9 ] She described it as an easy-going, but optimistic song that is "happy and hippy" rather than dance-oriented and said that the song "gives me such a great feeling when I listen to it. The lyrics are very hopeful and positive, but it's about love." [ 9 ] The single's cover artwork was revealed on September 24 and depicted Rihanna rolling diamonds in a manner suggestive of joint rolling. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] On September 26, Rihanna posted the full lyrics of the song in a PDF on her official website Rihanna7.com. [ 12 ] "Diamonds" premiered the same day on the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show , [ 13 ] and on the following day, it was released as a digital download on the 7 Digital store. [ 14 ] In the United Kingdom, the song was released to 7 Digital on September 28. [ 15 ] Def Jam Recordings solicited the single to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 2. [ 16 ] On November 5, it was released in Germany as a CD single , which it also contained the song's Bimbo Jones Vocal Remix.

[ 20 ] It features heavy synthesizers , [ 21 ] orchestral sounds and electronic rhythms accompanied with Rihanna's vocal performance.

[ 22 ] In a review of Unapologetic , Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe noted that an improvement in the singer's singing is evinced by ballads such as "Diamonds" and Stay ".

[ 23 ] Rihanna's vocals span from the low note of F ♯ 3 to the high note of F ♯ 5 . [ 23 ] Lyrically, "Diamonds" is a departure from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, [ 24 ] and contains a prominent concept of love. [ 25 ] The first verse introduces the song's concept: "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." The hook continues this metaphor: "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [ 26 ] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe , the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as "I choose to be happy" and "We're like diamonds in the sky". [ 24 ] James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line "When you hold me, I'm alive", and admits "I knew that we'd become one right away". [ 27 ] Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, "When you hold me, I'm alive," and "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." [ 28 ] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life. [ 29 ] Critical reception "Diamonds" was well received by most critics. In a positive review of the song, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave it four out of five stars and praised Rihanna's direction towards a "softer and more prolific edge".

[ 31 ] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday said that, although it does not sound like an emphatic hit, the lyrical content of the song depicts a "personal shift" for Rihanna. [ 32 ] According to James Montgomery of MTV News, "Diamonds" is more positive than previous singles such as " We Found Love " and " Where Have You Been ", despite its moderate tempo. [ 33 ] Lindsey DiMattina of Hollywood.com said that Rihanna's singing is stronger than ever. [ 28 ] Contactmusic 's reviewer described it as a "laid-back track", and suggested that the lyrical content is related to her former boyfriend Chris Brown . [ 34 ] In a track-by-track review of Unapologetic , Andrew Hampp of Billboard found the song inspiring and commented that it "finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date". [ 35 ] Andy Kellman of Allmusic cited the song as one of the highlights on Unapologetic , [ 19 ] and gave it three and a half stars. [ 36 ] In a less enthusiastic critique, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times likened "Diamonds" to a James Bond movie theme song, but with "insipid lyrics". [ 37 ] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News felt that the song is not as evocative as it attempts to be and lacks the sense of mystery and engaging production found on "We Found Love". [ 2 ] Kevin Blair of the Irish Independent ' s, Independent Woman, was critical of the song for deviating from Rihanna's previous dance and R&B songs and dismissed it as a "chugging, faintly misty-eyed, middle of the road pop song". [ 38 ] Chris Richards of The Washington Post panned the song as a "power ballad without much power". [ 39 ] Recognition and accolades Ernest Baker and Lauren Nostro of Complex ranked "Diamonds" atop their list of The 10 Best Guilty Pleasure Songs of 2012 and wrote that, although the song is unlike Rihanna's louder, more anthemic songs, "apparently the world loves to see a softer side of her, too."

[ 91 ] Music video Background and concept "With every song it's a different story, so the visuals are very specific to that story and that world. With 'Diamonds,' it was just a series of vignettes that we put together to help get the emotion across throughout the song 'cause the song changes and it builds, and there's no real way that you could do that." —Rihanna explaining the concept for the music video. [ 92 ] Rihanna began to film the music video for "Diamonds" on October 21, 2012, in Los Angeles, California. [ 33 ] It was directed by her regular collaborator Anthony Mandler , who previously directed her videos for " Russian Roulette " (2009) and " Man Down " (2011). [ 33 ] Photographs of the production leaked to the press the same day and showed Rihanna in a white and black dress in front of a fire. Ethan Sacks of the New York Daily News remarked that she "looked like a gem on the set of her video shoot." [ 93 ] Rihanna said that she wanted the video's abstract scenes to capture the appropriate emotion for the audience. [ 92 ] Mandler sought to create a "wider landscape" by suggesting and transfiguring ideas for viewers through the video: "[T]hey needed to feel like dream vignettes, like, when you wake up from a dream, you realize what you were dreaming about is not really what it was about, it was about something else." [ 94 ] He also tried to relate the video's concept to Rihanna's personal life: "What's truth or fiction? You know 'Is she drowning, or is she in complete ecstasy? Are those hands coming apart, or are they finding each other?' ... we tried to bring up these deeper questions that relate to song and her life and finding beauty in chaos and finding beauty in pain and finding pain in beauty." [ 94 ] On November 7, a behind-the-scenes video was posted on MTV 's official website. [ 95 ] It featured Rihanna in a "leopard-print" robe as she emerged from a trailer and headed to the shooting set. The scenes were intercut with police officers who chase armed fighters. Rihanna stands in a deserted landscape in the video's other scenes. [ 95 ] The music video for "Diamonds" premiered November 8 on MTV. The video was also made available for streaming at Rihanna.MTV.com. [ 95 ] It was digitally released on November 14 via the iTunes Store . [ 96 ] Synopsis A screenshot from the music video showing Rihanna's hand intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man. Some critics believed the arm of the man resembled that of Chris Brown . [ 97 ] The music video opens with a view of Rihanna lying in open waters, as other scenes of diamonds being rolled in a manner suggestive of making a joint are intercut – a scene reminiscent of the single's artwork. As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a black-and-white scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in reverse effect . Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from what appears to be the headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an aurora view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters. Reception Upon its release, the video received positive response from critics. James Montgomery of MTV News called it visually striking and observed a great deal of "evocative imagery (glamorous black-and-white close-ups, thick plumes of translucent smoke, oversaturated hill-scapes, artfully silhouetted stallions)". He said that, like the song, the video is by turns garish and very intimate. [ 98 ] The website's Jocelyn Vena thought that it had dreamlike and surrealistic images of Rihanna, who moves through set-ups that are occasionally exceptional. [ 99 ] E! Online's Bruna Nessif said that the video shows an abundance of elaborate imagery, narratives, and especially a "mysterious and sexy" Rihanna. [ 97 ] Additionally, she found it obvious that the body of a heavily tattooed man's arm, which Rihanna clings to desperately, is a reference to Chris Brown. [ 97 ] NME magazine observed Rihanna being shown in four environments that represent the four elements of the earth, air, water and fire. [ 100 ] Billy Johnson Jr. of Yahoo! Canada felt the video had failed to capture the song's vivid celebration of a love affair and stated, "It seems as though [Rihanna is] in chaos, reflecting on happier times." [ 101 ] Marc Hogan of Spin concluded that the video was a "confirmation of Rihanna's awkward segue into adult-contemporary-dom."
