[ 12 ] Oklahoma is the 20th most extensive and the 28th most populous of the 50 United States . The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words okla and humma , meaning "red people". [ 13 ] It is also known informally by its nickname, The Sooner State , in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land prior to the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory . The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as Oklahomans , or informally "Okies", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City . A major producer of natural gas , oil , and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology . [ 14 ] In 2007, it had one of the fastest-growing economies in the United States, ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas . [ 17 ] With small mountain ranges, prairie , mesas , and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains , Cross Timbers and the U.S. Interior Highlands —a region especially prone to severe weather . [ 18 ] In addition to having a prevalence of English , German , Scottish , Scotch-Irish , and Native American ancestry, more than 25 Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, [ 19 ] second only to California. Oklahoma is located on a confluence of three major American cultural regions and historically served as a route for cattle drives , a destination for southern settlers, and a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans.

Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of Indian Territory , in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word Indian , okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe Native American people as a whole. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory , and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.

State rock ( rose rock ) specimens from Cleveland County, with a US quarter for size reference. The state's high plains stretch behind a greeting sign in the Oklahoma Panhandle . A view of Mt Scott Oklahoma is the 20th largest state in the United States, covering an area of 69,898 square miles (181,035 km 2 ), with 68,667 square miles (177847 km 2 ) of land and 1,281 square miles (3,188 km 2 ) of water. [ 22 ] It is one of six states on the Frontier Strip and lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states . It is bounded on the east by Arkansas and Missouri , on the north by Kansas , on the northwest by Colorado , on the far west by New Mexico , and on the south and near-west by Texas . The western edge of the Oklahoma panhandle is out of alignment with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico border is actually 2.1 to 2.2 miles east of the Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first as a result of a survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd Meridian . In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered that the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake as it was than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the original surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian. Cimarron County in Oklahoma's panhandle is the only county in the United States that touches four other states: New Mexico, Texas, Colorado and Kansas. Topography [ edit ] See also: Lakes in Oklahoma Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, [ 23 ] generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa , at 4,973 feet (1,516 m) above sea level, situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle . The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel, OK , which dips to 289 feet (88 m) above sea level.

Medicine Park was one of the first resort communities established in the Wichita Mountains . A river carves a canyon in the Wichita Mountains. Among the most geographically diverse states, Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions , with 11 in its borders – more per square mile than in any other state. [ 18 ] Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare, relic species. [ 18 ] The Ouachita Mountains cover much of southeastern Oklahoma . Grave Creek in McIntosh County , Oklahoma Oklahoma has four primary mountain ranges: the Ouachita Mountains , the Arbuckle Mountains , the Wichita Mountains , and the Ozark Mountains . [ 24 ] Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains mark the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians . [ 27 ] A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the state's eastern border, Cavanal Hill is regarded by the Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department as the world's tallest hill; at 1,999 feet (609 m), it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot. [ 28 ] The semi-arid high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests; the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyons and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains . Partial plains interrupted by small, sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and the Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma ; transitional prairie and oak savannahs cover the central portion of the state. The Ozark and Ouachita Mountains rise from west to east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction. [ 25 ] [ 29 ] More than 500 named creeks and rivers make up Oklahoma's waterways, and with 200 lakes created by dams, it holds the highest number of artificial reservoirs in the nation. [ 28 ] Most of the state lies in two primary drainage basins belonging to the Red and Arkansas rivers, though the Lee and Little rivers also contain significant drainage basins. [ 29 ] Flora and fauna [ edit ] Populations of American bison inhabit the state's prairie ecosystems. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma [ 28 ] and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie , harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. [ 30 ] Where rainfall is sparse in the western regions of the state, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines , red cedar ( junipers ), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the far western reaches of the panhandle. [ 30 ] Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple , bigtooth maple , nolina and southern live oak . Marshlands , sabal minor , cypress forests and mixtures of shortleaf pine , loblolly pine and deciduous forests dominate the state's southeastern quarter , while mixtures of largely post oak , elm , red cedar ( Juniperus virginiana ) and pine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The state holds populations of white-tailed deer , mule deer , antelope , coyotes , mountain lions , bobcats , elk , and birds such as quail , doves , cardinals , bald eagles , red-tailed hawks , and pheasants . In prairie ecosystems, American bison , greater prairie chickens , badgers , and armadillo are common, and some of the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers , a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species . The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear , red fox , grey fox , and river otter populations, which coexist with a total of 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the American alligator . [ 30 ] Protected lands [ edit ] Mesas rise above one of Oklahoma's state parks. Oklahoma has 50 state parks , [ 32 ] six national parks or protected regions, [ 33 ] two national protected forests or grasslands , [ 34 ] and a network of wildlife preserves and conservation areas. Six percent of the state's 10 million acres (40,000 km 2 ) of forest is public land, [ 31 ] including the western portions of the Ouachita National Forest , the largest and oldest national forest in the Southern United States . [ 35 ] With 39,000 acres (158 km 2 ), the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in north-central Oklahoma is the largest protected area of tallgrass prairie in the world and is part of an ecosystem that encompasses only 10 percent of its former land area, once covering 14 states. [ 36 ] In addition, the Black Kettle National Grassland covers 31,300 acres (127 km 2 ) of prairie in southwestern Oklahoma. [ 37 ] The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is the oldest and largest of nine national wildlife refuges in the state [ 38 ] and was founded in 1901, encompassing 59,020 acres (238.8 km 2 ). [ 39 ] Of Oklahoma's federally protected park or recreational sites; the Chickasaw National Recreation Area is the largest, with 9,898.63 acres (18 km 2 ). [ 40 ] Other sites include the Santa Fe and Trail of Tears national historic trails, the Fort Smith and Washita Battlefield national historic sites, and the Oklahoma City National Memorial . [ 33 ] Climate [ edit ] Oklahoma's climate is prime for the generation of thunderstorms Winter at the Oklahoma Baptist University campus Oklahoma is located in a humid subtropical region. [ 41 ] Oklahoma lies in a transition zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. [ 26 ] An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world. [ 42 ] Because of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature and winds, weather patterns within the state can vary widely over relatively short distances and can change drastically in a short time. [ 26 ] As an example, on November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City reached 83 °F (28 °C) in the afternoon (the record high for that date), then an Arctic cold front of unprecedented intensity slammed across the state, causing the temperature to crash 66 degrees, down to 17 °F (−8 °C) at midnight (the record low for that date); thus, both the record high and record low for November 11 were set on the same date. [ 43 ] This type of phenomenon is also responsible for many of the tornadoes in the area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbreak , when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour over the course of a day. [ 44 ] The humid subtropical climate (Koppen Cfa ) of central, southern and eastern Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico . Traveling westward, the climate transitions progressively toward a semi-arid zone (Koppen BSk ) in the high plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward, less frequently touched by southern moisture. [ 41 ] Precipitation and temperatures decline from east to west accordingly, with areas in the southeast averaging an annual temperature of 62 °F (17 °C) and an annual rainfall of generally over 40 inches (1,020 mm) and up to 56 inches (1,420 mm), while areas of the (higher-elevation) panhandle average 58 °F (14 °C), with an annual rainfall under 17 inches (430 mm). [ 45 ] Over almost all of Oklahoma, winter is the driest season. Average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in May, the wettest month over most of the state, with its frequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activity. Early June can still be wet, but most years see a marked decrease in rainfall during June and early July. Mid-summer (July and August) represents a secondary dry season over much of Oklahoma, with long stretches of hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years. Severe drought is common in the hottest summers, such as those of 1934, 1954, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks on end of virtual rainlessness and high temperatures well over 100 °F (38 °C). Average precipitation rises again from September to mid-October, representing a secondary wetter season, then declines from late October through December. [ 26 ] All of the state frequently experiences temperatures above 100 °F (38 °C) or below 0 °F (−18 °C), [ 41 ] though below-zero temperatures are rare in south-central and southeastern Oklahoma. Snowfall ranges from an average of less than 4 inches (10 cm) in the south to just over 20 inches (51 cm) on the border of Colorado in the panhandle. [ 26 ] The state is home to the Storm Prediction Center , the National Severe Storms Laboratory , and the Warning Decision Training Branch , all part of the National Weather Service and located in Norman . [ 46 ] Oklahoma's highest recorded temperature of 120 °F (49 °C) was recorded at Tipton on June 27, 1994 and the lowest recorded temperature of −31 °F (−35 °C) was recorded at Nowata on February 10, 2011.

Britannica 9th ed. Evidence exists that native peoples traveled through Oklahoma as early as the last ice age . [ 49 ] Ancestors of the Wichita and Caddo lived in what is now Oklahoma. The Panhandle culture peoples were precontact residents of the panhandle region. The westernmost center of the Mississippian culture was Spiro Mounds , in what is now Spiro, Oklahoma , which flourished between AD 850 and 1450. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541, [ 52 ] but French explorers claimed the area in the 1700s [ 53 ] and it remained under French rule until 1803, when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase . [ 52 ] The territory now known as Oklahoma was first a part of the Arkansas Territory from 1819 until 1828. During the 19th century, thousands of Native Americans were expelled from their ancestral homelands from across North America and transported to the area including and surrounding present-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was the first of the Five Civilized Tribes to be removed from the southeastern United States. The phrase " Trail of Tears " originated from a description of the removal of the Choctaw Nation in 1831, although the term is usually used for the Cherokee removal. [ 54 ] A total of 17,000 Cherokees and 2,000 of their black slaves were deported. [ 55 ] The area, already occupied by Osage and Quapaw tribes, was called for the Choctaw Nation until revised Native American and then later American policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Americans. By 1890, more than 30 Native American nations and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indian Territory or "Indian Country". [ 56 ] All Five Civilized Tribes supported and signed treaties with the Confederate military during the American Civil War . The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war. [ 57 ] Slavery in Indian Territory was not abolished until 1866. [ 58 ] In the period between 1866 and 1899, [ 52 ] cattle ranches in Texas strove to meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Cattle trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory. [ 52 ] In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory. [ 59 ] Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government to establish the Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, railroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settlers and for purchase. [ 60 ] The Dust Bowl sent thousands of farmers into poverty during the 1930s. Major land runs , including the Land Run of 1889 , were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time. Usually land was open to settlers on a first come first served basis. [ 61 ] Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time were said to have been crossing the border sooner , leading to the term sooners , which eventually became the state's official nickname. [ 62 ] Deliberations to make the territory into a state began near the end of the 19th century, when the Curtis Act continued the allotment of Indian tribal land. 20th century [ edit ] Attempts to create an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt to create an all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. [ 63 ] On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in American history. The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry , as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the " Oil Capital of the World " for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy. [ 64 ] In 1927, Oklahoman businessman Cyrus Avery , known as the "Father of Route 66", began the campaign to create U.S. Route 66 . Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo, Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoma to form the original portion of Highway 66, Avery spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to oversee the planning of Route 66, based in his hometown of Tulsa. [ 65 ] Oklahoma also has a rich African American history. There were many black towns that thrived in the early 20th century because of black settlers moving from neighboring states, especially Kansas. The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged black settlers to come to what was then Indian Territory. He discussed with President Theodore Roosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-black state. By the early 20th century, the Greenwood neighborhood of Tulsa was one of the most prosperous African-American communities in the United States. [ 66 ] Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation since before the start of the 20th century, but the blacks had created a thriving area. Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. [ 67 ] By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state. [ 68 ] During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practices, extended drought and high winds. Known as the Dust Bowl , areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. [ 69 ] Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation. [ 18 ] [ 70 ] In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols detonated an explosive outside of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building , killed 168 people, including 19 children. The two men were convicted of the bombing: McVeigh was sentenced to death and executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001; his partner Nichols is serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. [ 71 ] McVeigh's army buddy, Michael Fortier, was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison and ordered to pay a $75,000 fine for his role in the bombing plot (i.e. assisting in the sale of guns to raise funds for the bombing, and examining the Murrah Federal building as a possible target prior to the terrorist attack). His wife, Lori Fortier, who has since died, was granted immunity from prosecution in return for her testimony in the case.

[ 78 ] As of 2008 [update] Oklahoma had a population of 3,642,361 [ 79 ] with an estimated 2005 ancestral makeup of 14.5% German, 13.1% American , 11.8% Irish , 9.6% English , 8.1% African American , and 11.4% Native American (including 7.9% Cherokee [ 80 ] ) though the percentage of people claiming American Indian as their only race was 8.1%. [ 81 ] Most people from Oklahoma who self-identify as having American ancestry are of overwhelmingly English ancestry with significant amounts of Scottish and Welsh inflection as well. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] The state had the second-highest number of Native Americans in 2002, estimated at 395,219, as well as the second highest percentage among all states. [ 80 ] As of 2006 [update] , 4.7% of Oklahoma's residents were foreign born, [ 84 ] compared to 12.4% for the nation. [ 85 ] The center of population of Oklahoma is located in Lincoln County near the town of Sparks . [ 86 ] The state's 2006 per capita personal income ranked 37th at $32,210, though it has the third fastest-growing per capita income in the nation [ 15 ] and ranks consistently among the lowest states in cost of living index.

[ 205 ] Oklahomans are in the upper half of Americans in terms of obesity prevalence, and the state is the 5th most obese in the nation, with 30.3 percent of its population at or near obesity. [ 206 ] Oklahoma ranked last among the 50 states in a 2007 study by the Commonwealth Fund on health care performance. [ 207 ] The OU Medical Center , Oklahoma's largest collection of hospitals, is the only hospital in the state designated a Level I trauma center by the American College of Surgeons . OU Medical Center is located on the grounds of the Oklahoma Health Center in Oklahoma City, the state's largest concentration of medical research facilities. [ 208 ] [ 209 ] The Cancer Treatment Centers of America at Southwestern Regional Medical Center in Tulsa is one of four such regional facilities nationwide, offering cancer treatment to the entire southwestern United States, and is one of the largest cancer treatment hospitals in the country. [ 210 ] The largest osteopathic teaching facility in the nation, Oklahoma State University Medical Center at Tulsa, also rates as one of the largest facilities in the field of neuroscience . [ 211 ] [ 212 ] Media [ edit ] Main articles: List of radio stations in Oklahoma and List of television stations in Oklahoma The second largest newspaper in Oklahoma, the Tulsa World has a circulation of 189,789. [ 213 ] Oklahoma City and Tulsa are the 45th and 61st-largest media markets in the United States as ranked by Nielsen Media Research . The state's third-largest media market, Lawton- Wichita Falls, Texas , is ranked 149th nationally by the agency. [ 214 ] Broadcast television in Oklahoma began in 1949 when KFOR-TV (then WKY-TV) in Oklahoma City and KOTV-TV in Tulsa began broadcasting a few months apart. [ 215 ] Currently, all major American broadcast networks have affiliated television stations in the state. [ 216 ] The state has two primary newspapers. The Oklahoman , based in Oklahoma City, is the largest newspaper in the state and 54th-largest in the nation by circulation, with a weekday readership of 138,493 and a Sunday readership of 202,690. The Tulsa World , the second most widely circulated newspaper in Oklahoma and 79th in the nation, holds a Sunday circulation of 132,969 and a weekday readership of 93,558. [ 213 ] Oklahoma's first newspaper was established in 1844, called the Cherokee Advocate , and was written in both Cherokee and English. [ 217 ] In 2006, there were more than 220 newspapers located in the state, including 177 with weekly publications and 48 with daily publications.

[ 220 ] Transportation [ edit ] One of ten major toll highways in Oklahoma, the Will Rogers Turnpike extends northeast from Tulsa. A map of Oklahoma showing major roads and thoroughfares. Transportation in Oklahoma is generated by an anchor system of Interstate Highways , intercity rail lines, airports, inland ports , and mass transit networks. Situated along an integral point in the United States Interstate network, Oklahoma contains three interstate highways and four auxiliary Interstate Highways . In Oklahoma City, Interstate 35 intersects with Interstate 44 and Interstate 40 , forming one of the most important intersections along the United States highway system. [ 221 ] More than 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of roads make up the state's major highway skeleton, including state-operated highways, ten turnpikes or major toll roads, [ 221 ] and the longest drivable stretch of Route 66 in the nation. [ 222 ] In 2008, Interstate 44 in Oklahoma City was Oklahoma's busiest highway, with a daily traffic volume of 123,300 cars. [ 223 ] In 2010, the state had the nation's third highest number of bridges classified as structurally deficient, with nearly 5,212 bridges in disrepair, including 235 National Highway System Bridges. [ 224 ] Oklahoma's largest commercial airport is Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, averaging a yearly passenger count of more than 3.5 million (1.7 million boardings) in 2010.

[ 229 ] In total, Oklahoma has over 150 public-use airports. [ 230 ] Oklahoma is connected to the nation's rail network via Amtrak 's Heartland Flyer , its only regional passenger rail line. It currently stretches from Oklahoma City to Fort Worth, Texas , though lawmakers began seeking funding in early 2007 to connect the Heartland Flyer to Tulsa . [ 231 ] Two inland ports on rivers serve Oklahoma: the Port of Muskogee and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa . The only port handling international cargo in the state, the Tulsa Port of Catoosa is the most inland ocean-going port in the nation and ships over two million tons of cargo each year. [ 232 ] [ 233 ] Both ports are located on the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System , which connects barge traffic from Tulsa and Muskogee to the Mississippi River via the Verdigris and Arkansas rivers, contributing to one of the busiest waterways in the world. [ 233 ] Law and government [ edit ] Main article: Government of Oklahoma The Oklahoma State Capitol located in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma is a constitutional republic with a government modeled after the Federal Government of the United States , with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. [ 234 ] The state has 77 counties with jurisdiction over most local government functions within each respective domain, [ 25 ] five congressional districts , and a voting base with a plurality in the Democratic Party . [ 235 ] State officials are elected by plurality voting in the state of Oklahoma. Oklahoma is one of 32 states with capital punishment as a legal sentence, and the state has had (between 1976 through mid-2011) the highest per capita execution rate in the US. [ 236 ] State government [ edit ] See also: Governor of Oklahoma , Oklahoma Legislature and Oklahoma Supreme Court The Legislature of Oklahoma consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives . As the lawmaking branch of the state government, it is responsible for raising and distributing the money necessary to run the government. The Senate has 48 members serving four-year terms, while the House has 101 members with two-year terms. The state has a term limit for its legislature that restricts any one person to a total of twelve cumulative years service between both legislative branches. [ 237 ] [ 238 ] Oklahoma's judicial branch consists of the Oklahoma Supreme Court , the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals , and 77 District Courts that each serves one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of Impeachment and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary . Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, as well as the Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a non-partisan retention vote on a six-year rotating schedule. [ 237 ] The Five congressional districts in Oklahoma. The executive branch consists of the Governor , their staff, and other elected officials. The principal head of government, the Governor is the chief executive of the Oklahoma executive branch, serving as the ex officio Commander-in-Chief of the Oklahoma National Guard when not called into Federal use and reserving the power to veto bills passed through the Legislature. The responsibilities of the Executive branch include submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and ensuring peace within the state is preserved. [ 239 ] Local government [ edit ] The state is divided into 77 counties that govern locally, each headed by a three-member council of elected commissioners, a tax assessor, clerk, court clerk , treasurer, and sheriff . [ 240 ] While each municipality operates as a separate and independent local government with executive, legislative and judicial power, county governments maintain jurisdiction over both incorporated cities and non-incorporated areas within their boundaries, but have executive power but no legislative or judicial power. Both county and municipal governments collect taxes, employ a separate police force, hold elections, and operate emergency response services within their jurisdiction. [ 241 ] [ 242 ] Other local government units include school districts , technology center districts, community college districts, rural fire departments, rural water districts, and other special use districts. Thirty-nine Native American tribal governments are based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within designated areas. While Indian reservations typical in most of the United States are not present in Oklahoma, tribal governments hold land granted during the Indian Territory era, but with limited jurisdiction and no control over state governing bodies such as municipalities and counties. Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval. [ 243 ] [ 244 ] Oklahoma has 11 substate districts including the two large Councils of Governments, INCOG in Tulsa (Indian Nations Council of Governments) and ACOG (Association of Central Oklahoma Governments).

National politics [ edit ] Presidential election results [ 245 ] Year Republicans Democrats 2012 66.77% 891,325 33.23% 443,547 2008 65.65% 960,165 34.35% 502,496 2004 65.57% 959,792 34.43% 503,966 2000 60.31% 744,337 38.43% 474,276 1996 48.26% 582,315 40.45% 488,105 1992 42.65% 592,929 34.02% 473,066 1988 57.93% 678,367 41.28% 483,423 1984 68.61% 861,530 30.67% 385,080 1980 60.50% 695,570 34.97% 402,026 1976 49.96% 545,708 48.75% 532,442 1972 73.70% 759,025 24.00% 247,147 1968 47.68% 449,697 31.99% 301,658 1964 44.25% 412,665 55.75% 519,834 1960 59.02% 533,039 40.98% 370,111 Main article: Politics of Oklahoma Oklahoma has been politically conservative for much of its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections ( 1920 and 1928 ). During this time, it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman . However, Oklahoma Democrats were generally considered to be more conservative than Democrats in other states. After the 1948 election , the state turned firmly Republican. Although registered Republicans were a minority in the state until 2015, [ 246 ] starting in 1952 , Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election ( 1964 ). This is not to say that every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976 , while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000 , though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in both 2008 and 2012 . Generally, Republicans are strongest in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and their suburbs, as well as the Panhandle. Democrats are strongest in the eastern part of the state and Little Dixie , as well as the most heavily African American parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. With a population of 8.6% Native American in the state, it is also worth noting that most Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded only by African Americans . [ 247 ] Following the 2000 census , the Oklahoma delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one congressional district . For the 112th Congress (2011–2013), there were no changes in party strength, and the delegation included four Republicans and one Democrat. In the 112th Congress, Oklahoma's U.S. senators were Republicans Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn , and its U.S. Representatives were John Sullivan (R-OK-1), Dan Boren (D-OK-2), Frank D. Lucas (R-OK-3), Tom Cole (R-OK-4), and James Lankford (R-OK-5). In 2012, Dan Boren (D-OK-2) retired from Congress, therefore making the seat vacant. This district, which covers most of Little Dixie, is the Democrats' best region of the state, and has been represented by a Democrat for a dozen years. Republican Markwayne Mullin won the election, making the state's congressional delegation entirely Republican.

Oklahoma had 598 incorporated places in 2010, including four cities over 100,000 in population and 43 over 10,000. [ 248 ] Two of the fifty largest cities in the United States are located in Oklahoma, Oklahoma City and Tulsa , and 65 percent of Oklahomans live within their metropolitan areas, or spheres of economic and social influence defined by the United States Census Bureau as a metropolitan statistical area . Oklahoma City, the state's capital and largest city, had the largest metropolitan area in the state in 2010, with 1,252,987 people, and the metropolitan area of Tulsa had 937,478 residents. [ 249 ] Between 2000 and 2010, the cities that led the state in population growth were Blanchard (172.4%), Elgin (78.2%), Jenks (77.0%), Piedmont (56.7%), Bixby (56.6%), and Owasso (56.3%). [ 248 ] Tulsa is the state's second largest city by population and land area. In descending order of population, Oklahoma's largest cities in 2010 were: Oklahoma City (579,999, +14.6%), Tulsa (391,906, −0.3%), Norman (110,925, +15.9%), Broken Arrow (98,850, +32.0%), Lawton (96,867, +4.4%), Edmond (81,405, +19.2%), Moore (55,081, +33.9%), Midwest City (54,371, +0.5%), Enid (49,379, +5.0%), and Stillwater (45,688, +17.0%). Of the state's ten largest cities, three are outside the metropolitan areas of Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and only Lawton has a metropolitan statistical area of its own as designated by the United States Census Bureau, though the metropolitan statistical area of Fort Smith, Arkansas extends into the state. [ 88 ] Under Oklahoma law, municipalities are divided into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have legislative , judicial , and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose between a mayor-council , council-manager , or strong mayor form of government, while towns operate through an elected officer system.

[ 250 ] See also: List of Oklahoma state symbols State law codifies Oklahoma's state emblems and honorary positions; [ 251 ] the Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for special events and to benefit organizations. Currently the State Senate is waiting to vote on a change to the state's motto. The House passed HCR 1024, which will change the state motto from "Labor Omnia Vincit" to "Oklahoma-In God We Trust!" The author of the resolution stated that a constituent researched the Oklahoma Constitution and found no "official" vote regarding "Labor Omnia Vincit", therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto.
