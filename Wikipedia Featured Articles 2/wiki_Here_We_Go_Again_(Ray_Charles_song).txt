It was produced by Joe Adams for ABC Records / Tangerine Records . To date, this version of the song has been the biggest commercial success, spending twelve consecutive weeks on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , peaking at number 15. The most notable cover version is a rhythm and blues duet by Charles and Norah Jones , which appeared on the 2004 album Genius Loves Company . This version has been the biggest critical success. When Genius Loves Company was released, "Here We Go Again" earned Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Collaboration at the 47th Grammy Awards posthumously for Charles who died in 2004. Another notable version by Nancy Sinatra charted for five weeks in 1969. Johnny Duncan charted the song on Billboard 's Hot Country Songs chart for five weeks in 1972, while Roy Clark did so for seven weeks in 1982. The song has been covered in a wide variety of musical genres. In total, five different versions have been listed on the music charts. Although its two most successful versions have been rhythm and blues recordings, many of its other notable covers were featured on country music albums. "Here We Go Again" was first covered in an instrumental jazz format, and many of the more recent covers have been sung as duets , such as one with Willie Nelson and Norah Jones with Wynton Marsalis accompanying. The song was released on their 2011 tribute album Here We Go Again: Celebrating the Genius of Ray Charles . The song lent its name to Red Steagall's 2007 album as well. Cover versions have appeared on compilation albums by a number of artists, even some who did not release "Here We Go Again" as a single.

[ 1 ] According to Will Friedwald in A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers , "His first four ABC albums were all primarily devoted to standards ..." [ 2 ] In the 1960s, he experienced crossover success with both rhythm and blues and country music. Because Charles was signed to ABC as a rhythm and blues singer, he decided to wait until his contract was up for its three-year renewal before experimenting with country music, although he wanted to do so sooner. With the assistance of ABC executive Sid Feller , he gathered a set of country songs to record, despite the wishes of ABC. [ 3 ] The release of his 1962 country albums, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music and its follow-up Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2 , broadened the appeal of his music to the mainstream. At this point, Charles began to appeal more to a white audience. [ 4 ] In 1962, he founded his own record label, Tangerine Records, which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] "Here We Go Again" was recorded during a phase in Charles' career when he was focused on performing country music. [ 7 ] Thus, "Here We Go Again" was a country music song released by the Tangerine label ABC-Paramount, but performed in Charles' rhythm and blues style. However, his works did not bear the Tangerine label until 1968. [ 8 ] Feller left ABC in 1965, [ 9 ] but he returned to arrange Charles' 1967 album, Ray Charles Invites You to Listen . [ 10 ] Joe Adams produced and engineered the album, which included "Here We Go Again". [ 10 ] First released by Charles in 1967, "Here We Go Again" was written by Lanier and Steagall and published by the Dirk Music Company. [ 11 ] Charles recorded it at RPM International Studios, Los Angeles, [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and the song was listed as the sixth of ten tracks on Ray Charles Invites You to Listen . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Starting in 1987, it was included in numerous greatest hits and compilation albums. [ 17 ] When Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music was reissued in 1988, the song was added as a bonus track. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] It was also included on the 1988 album Ray Charles Anthology . [ 18 ] Composition [ edit ] "Here We Go Again" (1967) Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player. You can download the clip or download a player to play the clip in your browser. Ray Charles ' "Here We Go Again" from Ray Charles Invites You to Listen is the first notable cover of the song. It is a rhythm & blues version from the part of Charles's career when he was recording country music . Problems playing this file? See media help . Steagall endured polio as a teen and learned how to play the guitar and mandolin during his recuperation. [ 19 ] This activity helped him regain the use of his left arm and hand. [ 20 ] When he enrolled at West Texas State University , he formed his first country band. [ 19 ] Don Lanier formed a group by the name of The Rhythm Orchids along with Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen . [ 21 ] He was hired as a soil chemist but played weekends at country dances. After he quit his professional role, he formed a band that became popular in the Rocky Mountain ski-resort clubs. [ 22 ] He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 and embarked on folk club performing and songwriting. [ 23 ] He wrote for two music publishers, Tree and Combine, before signing with Capitol Records . [ 22 ] Eventually, Steagall joined Lanier and Bowen. Steagall and Lanier co-wrote "Here We Go Again". [ 21 ] Steagall's first break came when Charles covered "Here We Go Again". [ 19 ] Steagall says that the song "came about in a very unusual manner and very quickly". [ 21 ] One source even claims that Steagall did not come to Hollywood until after Charles recorded the song. [ 24 ] According to the sheet music published by Dirk Music, "Here We Go Again" is set in 12/8 time with a slow shuffle tempo of sixty-nine beats per minute . The song is written in the key of B ♭ major . [ 25 ] It is primarily a country song, [ 26 ] but it contains gospel influences. [ 27 ] According to Matthew Greenwald of Allmusic , "'Here We Go Again' is a soulful ballad in the Southern blues tradition. Lyrically, it has a resignation and pain that makes the blues, simply, what it is. The recording has a simple and sterling gospel arrangement and, in retrospect, is one of Charles' finer attempts in the studio from the 1960s." [ 28 ] Performance history [ edit ] The playlist of the 1967 tour promoting Ray Charles Invites You to Listen is not readily available, but "Here We Go Again" was the best-charting song on the album (and likely on the playlist). Charles' tour began with a benefit concert on the USS Constellation , which was preparing to depart for the Vietnam War from San Diego Harbor . The tour, Charles' first since 1964, continued to Europe in mid-April where it visited the Royal Festival Hall , London and Salle Pleyel , Paris, as well as Vienna. In May, the band played back in the United States at New York City's Carnegie Hall before returning to California. The tour received bad reviews from publications such as Jazz Journal , Jazz Magazine and New York Post . Later that summer, the band played Constitution Hall , Washington, D.C. In the fall, Charles had his first lucrative Nevada casino performances, which started with a three-week run at Harrah's Reno that was praised in Variety . The tour also had an extended fall run at the Copacabana nightclub . [ 29 ] Reception [ edit ] Greenwald described the original version of "Here We Go Again" as "Another excellent example of how Ray Charles was able to fuse blues and country". [ 28 ] In a review for the single, a writer for Billboard magazine wrote that the song could easily be a "blockbuster" for Charles. [ 26 ] The original version debuted at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the May 20, 1967, issue and number 48 on the US Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles top 50 chart on June 10, 1967. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] For the weeks ending July 15, July 22 and July 29, the song spent three weeks at its peak position of number 15 on the Hot 100 chart. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] It spent July 22 and July 29 at its peak position of number 5 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] By August 12, it fell out the Hot 100 chart, ending a 12-week run. [ 36 ] It remained on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart for 13 weeks ending on September 2. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] "Here We Go Again" was Charles' last single to enter the top twenty of the Hot 100. [ 39 ] For the year 1967 the song finished at number 80 on the US Billboard Year-End Hot 100 chart and 33 on the Year-End Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. [ 40 ] Abroad, it debuted on the UK Singles Chart top 40 at number 38 on July 8, 1967, which would be its peak. [ 41 ] It totalled 3 non-consecutive weeks on the chart. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] In the Netherlands, "Here We Go Again" appeared on the singles chart at number 10 on July 15, 1967, and later peaked at number three. [ 44 ] According to Will Friedwald , this song is an example of Charles vocalizing in what would ordinarily be an generally extraneous manner for dramatic effect by using a different voice than he had ever previously exhibited. He sang "... not just using the squeak—using a whole new kind of squeak, in fact—for additional coloring on the sidelines, but making it the heart of the matter, literally squeaking out the words and notes in harmony with the Raelettes " (his background singers ). [ 2 ] Track listing [ edit ] 7-inch single [ 45 ] "Here We Go Again" – 3:14 "Somebody Ought to Write a Book About It" – 3:02 According to Allmusic, the solo version is listed at lengths between 3:14 and 3:20 on various albums. [ 17 ] Credits [ edit ] Charles is credited as vocalist and pianist with unknown accompaniment. Feller is credited for having arranged and conducted the recording. This is one of two songs on the album (" Yesterday " being the other) that in addition to being listed as ABC-Par ABC595 is credited as Dunhill DZS036 [CD]. [ 46 ] The individual song had a label number ABC/TRC 10938. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] " In the Heat of the Night " also had a Dunhill credit but a different number for both Dunhill and ABC.

[ 49 ] The cover, which according to programming guides had an easy listening and country music appeal, [ 50 ] was produced by Billy Strange . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] The B-side to the single, "Memories", was written by Strange along with Mac Davis . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Billboard magazine staff reviewed the song favorably, stating that the cover was a "smooth sing-a-long pop style". [ 52 ] They also commended Sinatra's singing, calling it a "fine" performance, noting that it would likely return her to the Billboard charts. [ 52 ] Sinatra's version was later remastered and reissued in 1996. [ 54 ] Chart performance [ edit ] Although CD Universe describes the song as a country music song, [ 49 ] it never charted on country music charts.

[ 63 ] It peaked at number 21 for the week of June 16, 1969. [ 64 ] The song spent a total of five weeks on the chart. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] According to Allmusic databases, 1969 was the final year in her career that Sinatra reached the Hot 100 chart (with "Here We Go Again", "God Knows I Love You" and "Drummer Man"). [ 67 ] Track listing [ edit ] 7-inch vinyl single [ 53 ] "Here We Go Again" – 3:07 "Memories" – 3:40 According to Allmusic the original track was 3:09, but when it appeared on the 2006 compilation album Essential Nancy Sinatra , it was 3:11. [ 68 ] The single was initially released through Reprise Records. In a non-exclusive licensing agreement, Reprise (part of Warner Music ) gave RCA Records the rights to distribute the records of some of their artists including Sinatra and Dean Martin . [ 69 ] In 1971, Sinatra and Reprise parted ways, so she signed a long term contract with RCA Records. [ 70 ] Credits [ edit ] The following musicians performed on this track: [ 51 ] B.J.

Burk Ray Charles singles chronology "Mother" (2002) "Here We Go Again" (2004) "You Don't Know Me" (2005) Norah Jones singles chronology "Those Sweet Words" (2004) "Here We Go Again" (2004) " Thinking About You " (2006) In 2004, Charles re-recorded "Here We Go Again" as a duet with American singer-songwriter Norah Jones , who grew up listening to his music. [ 71 ] During Jones' Billboard interview for her 2010 collaboration album ...Featuring , which included her "Here We Go Again" duet, she said "I got a call from Ray asking if I'd be interested in singing on this duets record. I got on the next plane and I brought my mom. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. I sang it right next to Ray, watching his mouth for the phrasing. He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [ 72 ] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. [ 73 ] On the record, the two singers' vocalize, [ 74 ] accompanied by Billy Preston on Hammond organ , [ 75 ] [ 76 ] who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band. [ 71 ] Reception [ edit ] Jones in April 2005, 2 months after "Here We Go Again" won a Grammy Award Jones when ...Featuring was released in November 2010 As part of Charles' Grammy Award for Album of the Year winning Genius Loves Company , the song proved to be the most popular and critically acclaimed on the album. Although the song had its early detractors, [ 77 ] [ 78 ] it received mostly favorable reviews. Several reviewers noted the complementarity of Jones and Charles. The Daily Vault 's Jason Warburg described the song as a "jazzy, slinky pas de deux " in which Charles matches Jones note for note." [ 79 ] JazzTimes ' Christopher Loudon said Charles "blends seamlessly with Jones on a velvet-and- buckram " performance. [ 80 ] The song was described by the Orlando Sentinel 's Jim Abbott as a recreation of one of the gems from Charles' country music phase of the 1960s that produced the perfect "combination of voices and instruments" with Preston's accompanying role on Hammond B3 . [ 7 ] As opposed to other tracks on the album, when Charles' voice was understated, this song was said to represent his "indomitable spirit", while Jones performed as "an empathetic foil, [with] her warm, lazy vocals meshing convivially with his over a spare but funky arrangement". [ 71 ] Author Mike Evans wrote that "there's a mutual warmth of purpose in every breath [Charles and Jones] take" on the song. [ 75 ] Music Week staff noted the timeliness of the release with Ray in theaters and described the song as soulful, that finely combines Charles' "deep, honeyed growl with Jones's lighter timber", while noting Preston for his "sweeping" organ work. [ 81 ] The song received other specific forms of praise. Robert Christgau notes that Jones carried the vocal burden as did many of his duet partners on the album. [ 82 ] USA Today 's Steve Jones said the song "strikes an easy groove". [ 76 ] PopMatters ' Kevin Jagernauth says "Jones nicely compliments Charles on this beautiful opening track". [ 27 ] Preston's performance was favorably described by The Washington Post 's Richard Harrington as "smoky". [ 71 ] Critic Randy Lewis from the Chicago Tribune noted that the song's "countrified ache" represented that part of Charles' career. [ 83 ] When the song was included on Jones' ...Featuring , which included three of her collaborations from Albums of the Year and several from albums that were nominees, [ 84 ] the song did not stand out. Few of the reviews at Metacritic had substantive comments on the duet when included among her group of collaborations. [ 85 ] While reviewing ...Featuring , Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine wrote that the duet was a "more staid and less compelling recording" on the album. [ 86 ] However, Allmusic staff noted that she worked comfortably with Charles and Chris Rizik of Soul Tracks said the track was more than just filler.

[ 93 ] The song, which had a length of 5:10, was arranged by Andy Farber and performed in a rhythm and blues 12/8 shuffle . [ 93 ] BBC music reviewer Bill Tilland noted that Jones added her usual "style and panache" to this performance. [ 130 ] At one concert performance, The New York Times critic Nate Chinen felt the song sounded unrehearsed. [ 131 ] Although critique of this track is sparse, Pop Matters ′ Will Layman notes that the album reveals "how decisive and strong Jones sounds while singing with a truly legitimate jazz group" and how Nelson predictably "breezes through his tunes with cavalier grace". Meanwhile, he praises the professional mastery of Marsalis' quintet. [ 132 ] Tilland also notes that on the album Marsalis' band "compensates quite adequately for occasional lacklustre vocals." [ 130 ] George Strait's country music version was performed with the instrumental support of Joe Chemay (bass guitar), Floyd Domino (piano), Buddy Emmons (steel guitar), Steve Gibson ( acoustic guitar ), Johnny Gimble ( fiddle ), Jim Horn ( saxophone , alto flute ), Larrie Londin (drums), Liana Manis (background vocals), Curtis Young (background vocals), and Reggie Young ( electric guitar ).

[ 134 ] Allmusic staff noted that the album held its own at the time of release against most of its competitors and has aged better than most country music albums. [ 135 ] Ralph Novak, Lisa Shea, Eric Levin, and Craig Tomashoff of People said the album represents the most straightforward style of singing. [ 136 ] The iTunes Store describes the album as the result of a transition in eras of country music. [ 137 ] The song plays during the opening credit dance by Franz ( Harry Baer ) and Margarethe ( Margarethe von Trotta ) in Rainer Werner Fassbinder 's 1970 film Gods of the Plague . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] However, the song was on neither the eponymous soundtrack for the 2004 film Ray nor the limited edition additional soundtrack album More Music From Ray .
