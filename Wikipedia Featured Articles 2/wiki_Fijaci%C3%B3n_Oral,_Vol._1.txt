It was released on 3 June 2005 by Epic Records . After attaining international success in 2001 with her first English record, Laundry Service , Shakira wanted to release a fifth Spanish-language project as its followup. In the vein of her earlier work, Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 is a Latin pop album. Shakira enlisted Rick Rubin as executive producer , also working with Gustavo Cerati , Lester Mendez , Luis F. Ochoa and Jose "Gocho" Torres. At its release Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who complimented Shakira's evolution from her earlier work. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 , with first-week sales of 157,000 copies. It set a record as the highest debut for a full-length Spanish-language album in the country which still stands. Internationally, the album topped the charts in Argentina, Germany, Mexico and Spain. Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 was the Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards , and the Album of the Year and the Best Female Pop Vocal Album at the Latin Grammy Awards . Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 became the highest selling Latin pop album of the decade in the United States and the second highest selling Latin album overall. As of May 2013, over four million copies of the album were sold worldwide and it is one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States . Four singles were released to promote the album. Although its lead single (" La Tortura ") was the only track to reach the US Billboard Hot 100 , the follow-up singles " No ", " Día de Enero " and " Las de la Intuición " enjoyed moderate success on the Hot Latin Songs , Tropical Songs and Latin Pop Airplay charts. In November 2005 Shakira supplemented the album with her second English-language record, Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 .

The projects were promoted with the Oral Fixation Tour in 2006 and 2007, which visited the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. A performance in Miami , Florida was filmed and released as a live album in November 2007.

Having co-written nearly sixty songs for the project, she decided to divide the release into two volumes and put herself "on the mission of selecting [her] favorite ones" to record. Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 contains all Spanish-language songs and Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 features all English-language tracks. [ 1 ] Shakira initially said that the second volume would have a "completely new repertory of songs", [ 1 ] although the completed album included two English translations of songs from the first record. [ 2 ] It was reissued in 2006 as an expanded version with an additional translated recording and her future international-hit single, " Hips Don't Lie ". [ 3 ] When recording the albums, she worked with previous collaborators Lester Mendez and Luis Fernando Ochoa and new partners Gustavo Cerati and Jose "Gocho" Torres. [ 4 ] Cover art [ edit ] The album's cover was influenced by the biblical figure of Eve ( pictured ). The artwork for both Oral Fixation albums was inspired by Eve , the first woman; Shakira said she wanted "to attribute to Eve one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit, and that would be her oral fixation" and that "[she always felt] that [she has] been a very oral person. [It is her] biggest source of pleasure". The first volume's cover sees Shakira holding a baby girl in her arms; the artwork for the second album shows a nude Shakira (covered by tree branches), with the infant sitting in the tree. She stated that both covers alluded to psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud 's theory that infants begin discovering the world through their mouths during the oral stage of psychosexual development . [ 5 ] For Jon Pareles of The New York Times , "For obvious reasons, it's eye-catching, as was the cover of the Spanish-language companion album, "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1". [ 5 ] In the Middle East version of the album, Shakira was covered up with leaves. [ 6 ] Complex magazine selected "Oral Fixation" album cover as the eleventh "sexiest album cover of all time", writing that it is "the hottest portrayal of Eve in the Garden of Eden we can imagine." [ 7 ] Maxim also listed the album's cover as one of the "sexiest album covers", writing that, "A naked girl holding up an apple in a garden is played out, but not when the girl is hip-shaking Shakira. Damn, it could happen all over again, couldn't it?." [ 8 ] Composition [ edit ] "La Tortura" (2005) Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player.

[ 11 ] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said that executive producer Rick Rubin helped "restore Shakira's artistic integrity by keeping the industry at bay". [ 12 ] Yahoo!

[ 43 ] Jon Pareles of The New York Times found Shakira's "smart or ambitious" image to be uncharacteristic of a sex symbol . He praised the versatility of her multilingual lyrics and her experimentation in a number of genres, citing the "multiplicity" in "the arrangements, in the mixed emotions of the lyrics, [and] in Shakira's mercurial voice". [ 11 ] Writing for Paste , Mark Kemp complimented Shakira for dispelling notions she is"the Latin Britney , the female Ricky Martin [and] the pretty pop tart who sings in Spanish and sounds like Alanis "; he compared the mix of musical elements in Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 to a Pop-Tart with a "rich and nutritious filling". [ 44 ] Tom Townsend of Yahoo! Music called her "the greatest pop star we have", comparing her "consuming artistry" to that of Madonna and Prince . He credited the album for inspiring a revival of pop music, saying that the release proved that the genre "wasn't dead, just sleeping". [ 45 ] Shakira's international success was solidified with Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 ' s strong commercial performance. After it debuted at number 4 on the US Billboard 200 and became the highest-debuting full-length Spanish album in the country, her label Epic Records called her "the biggest female crossover artist in the world". [ 46 ] The album remains her second-highest-charting release in the nation, behind Laundry Service ' s peak position at number 3. [ 16 ] According to Billboard , it was the second best-selling Latin album of the decade in the US after Barrio Fino by Daddy Yankee .
