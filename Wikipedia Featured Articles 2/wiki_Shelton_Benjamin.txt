[ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Benjamin then attended Lassen Community College in Susanville, California and became a National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) track and field champion in the 100 meter as well as a NJCAA collegiate wrestling champion. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] He then transferred to the University of Minnesota on a wrestling scholarship for his junior and senior years of college where he achieved a 36–6 overall win-loss record. [ 1 ] [ 6 ] After graduation, he served as an assistant wrestling coach at his alma mater and trained with future Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) tag team partner Brock Lesnar . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 7 ] Benjamin thought about trying to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics but decided instead to pursue a professional wrestling career. [ 7 ] Professional wrestling career [ edit ] World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment [ edit ] Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) [ edit ] In 2000, Benjamin signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was placed in its developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, he formed a tag team with Brock Lesnar , where he was wrestling Brock's wrestling coach at the University of Minnesota . [ 8 ] Together, they were known as the " Minnesota Stretching Crew ," [ 7 ] and they held the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions. [ 9 ] The first two reigns occurred during February and July 2001. [ 7 ] They won the title for a third time from Rico Constantino and The Prototype on October 29, 2001. [ 7 ] After Lesnar was called up to the main roster in November 2001, Benjamin formed a tag team with Redd Dogg Begnaud called "The Dogg Pound" and once again won the OVW Southern Tag Team Title on July 17, 2002. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] Benjamin then wrestled at several house shows for the main WWE roster and eventually made his WWE television debut on Sunday Night Heat as a face character . [ 7 ] The World's Greatest Tag Team (2003–2004) [ edit ] Main article: The World's Greatest Tag Team Benjamin with his WWE Tag Team Championship belt and Team Angle hoodie He joined WWE's SmackDown brand as a villain on January 2, 2003, forming an alliance with Charlie Haas and Olympic gold-medalist Kurt Angle as their on-screen mentor known as "Team Angle". [ 10 ] Their first official match together in WWE was on the January 2, 2003 episode of SmackDown against Edge and Chris Benoit . [ 11 ] They continued their storyline feud with Benoit until No Way Out , when Benoit teamed with Brock Lesnar to defeat Team Angle. [ 12 ] The duo were scripted to win their first WWE Tag Team Championship just a month after their debut by defeating the champions, Los Guerreros ( Eddie and Chavo Guerrero ) on February 6, 2003. [ 13 ] The two then went on to compete in their first WrestleMania match at WrestleMania XIX , retaining their tag title in a Triple Threat match against Los Guerreros, and Chris Benoit and Rhyno . [ 7 ] Team Angle later lost the title to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner Tajiri at Judgment Day in a ladder match . [ 7 ] The storyline concluded on the June 12, 2003 episode of SmackDown! , when Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas and fired them from Team Angle. [ 14 ] They then began referring to themselves as "The World's Greatest Tag Team " and won the tag titles back on the July 3 episode of Smackdown . [ 15 ] They lost the title on September 18, after Benjamin suffered a legitimate knee injury during a match against Los Guerreros. [ 16 ] Benjamin was sidelined for approximately one month, [ 7 ] but the pair competed together again, taking part in a Fatal Four-Way match at WrestleMania XX . [ 17 ] Intercontinental Champion (2004–2007) [ edit ] On March 22, 2004, Benjamin was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2004 WWE draft . [ 18 ] After arriving, Benjamin quickly became a face when he scored an upset pinfall victory over Triple H . [ 19 ] Benjamin then feuded with Triple H, beating him three times in total: once by pinfall, once by count-out , and once by disqualification . [ 20 ] As part of the storyline, Benjamin then feuded with the other members of Triple H's stable Evolution . Benjamin defeated Ric Flair at Backlash and lost to Randy Orton in an Intercontinental Championship match at Bad Blood . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] During a match with Garrison Cade on Heat , Benjamin punched Cade's knee brace, legitimately breaking his hand in the process and briefly taking him out of action. [ 7 ] Benjamin returned in the fall of 2004 helping Randy Orton fight off Evolution and was later chosen by the fans to compete for the Intercontinental Championship in a match against then-champion Chris Jericho at Taboo Tuesday . Benjamin was scripted to win the match, [ 23 ] giving him his first singles title in the company. [ 1 ] During his reign as Intercontinental Champion, Benjamin retained the title against challengers such as Christian at Survivor Series , [ 24 ] Maven at New Year's Revolution , [ 25 ] and Chris Jericho at Backlash . [ 26 ] Benjamin lost the title to Carlito when he debuted on Raw (Carlito used the ropes during the pinfall.) during the June 20, 2005 episode, ending the longest Intercontinental Championship reign of the decade. [ 27 ] Benjamin's next storyline began on the December 5, 2005 episode of Raw , when Shawn Michaels was scripted to give Benjamin a speech to get him "psyched" for their tag match together later in the night. [ 28 ] As a part of the scripted ending to the match, Michaels was preparing to finish the match when Benjamin tagged himself in and missed a crossbody, allowing Carlito to pin Benjamin. [ 1 ] Benjamin was then depicted as having a "losing streak" over the next several weeks, [ 1 ] which led to Benjamin's noisy, scolding, and domineering " Momma " (played by comedian/actress Thea Vidale ) coming to Raw to confront Benjamin. Momma slapped and yelled at Benjamin every time he lost a match. [ 29 ] Before long, she assisted Benjamin in his matches, often interfering on his behalf. [ 30 ] This led to Benjamin once again becoming a villain for the first time since 2004. In 2006, Benjamin had a staged on-screen rivalry with then-Intercontinental Champion Ric Flair . On the February 20 episode of Raw , Benjamin defeated Flair to regain the Intercontinental Championship after Momma faked a heart problem, causing enough of a distraction to allow Benjamin to cheat and win the title. [ 31 ] Benjamin continued to feud with Flair, but Momma no longer accompanied him to ringside. As part of the scripted events, Benjamin stated that she was undergoing heart surgery in the hospital and that he held Flair responsible. [ 32 ] Benjamin competed in the second Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 22 . [ 33 ] Benjamin then had an on-screen rivalry with the winner of that match, Rob Van Dam , in an attempt to take Van Dam's Money in the Bank contract. During this time, Benjamin emphasized his new heel persona with a new gimmick : wearing shades, jewelry, and occasional colored shirts while entering the ring. [ 34 ] At one point, Benjamin was defeated by his former tag team partner, the returning Charlie Haas , during an episode of Raw . A predetermined stipulation added to this loss meant that Benjamin had to defend the Intercontinental Title in the same match as his shot at Van Dam's contract, [ 35 ] meaning at Backlash it would be a "Winner Takes All" match. Rob Van Dam won at Backlash and became Intercontinental Champion. [ 36 ] Benjamin regained the title from Rob Van Dam in a Tornado Tag Team match , pitting Benjamin, Triple H and Chris Masters against Van Dam and WWE Champion John Cena ; [ 7 ] both the WWE Championship and WWE Intercontinental Championship could be won by whoever pinned the appropriate champion. After Triple H Pedigreed Van Dam, he turned his attention to John Cena and went for the pin on the WWE Champion. Benjamin got to Van Dam first, picking up the pin and his third Intercontinental Championship. [ 37 ] Subsequently, Benjamin feuded with Carlito and others for his Intercontinental Championship before losing the title to Johnny Nitro in a Triple Threat match also involving Carlito at Vengeance . [ 38 ] During December 2006, Benjamin's former tag team partner Charlie Haas came out to celebrate with Benjamin after he defeated Super Crazy . [ 39 ] The World's Greatest Tag Team was officially reunited when they defeated The Highlanders on the December 11, 2006 episode of Raw .

On ECW's 100th episode, however, Benjamin defeated Kingston, thus ending the latter's undefeated streak. To end the feud, Kingston then defeated Benjamin in an ECW Extreme Rules match.
