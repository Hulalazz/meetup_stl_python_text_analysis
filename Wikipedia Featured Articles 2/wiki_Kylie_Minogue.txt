She achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera Neighbours , where she played tomboy mechanic Charlene Robinson . Appearing in the series for two years, Minogue's character married Scott Robinson ( Jason Donovan ) in an episode viewed by nearly 20 million people in the United Kingdom making it one of the most watched Australian TV episodes ever. [ 5 ] Since then, Minogue has been a recording artist and has achieved commercial success and critical acclaim in the entertainment industry. Minogue has been recognised with several honorific nicknames including "Princess of Pop" and "Goddess of Pop". She is recognised as the highest-selling Australian artist of all time by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Born and raised in Melbourne , Australia, Minogue has for many years worked and lived in London . She signed to PWL in 1987 and released her first studio album Kylie the next year. In 1992, she left PWL and signed with Deconstruction Records and where she created her self-titled studio album and Impossible Princess , both of which received positive reviews from critics. Returning to more mainstream dance-oriented music, Minogue signed to Parlophone and released " Spinning Around ". [ 6 ] Her 2001 single " Can't Get You Out of My Head " became one of the most successful singles during the 2000s, selling over ten million units. It is recognised as her " signature song " and was named "...the catchiest song ever" by Yahoo! Music . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Her album Fever (2001) was a hit in many countries, including the United States. Throughout her career, Minogue has released many successful singles, including " The Loco-Motion ", " Especially for You ", " Hand on Your Heart ", " Better the Devil You Know ", " Confide in Me ", "Spinning Around", " Slow ", " 2 Hearts " and " All The Lovers ". In 2005, while Minogue was on her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour , she was diagnosed with breast cancer. After treatment, she resumed the tour under the title Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour , which critics viewed as a "triumph". [ 9 ] Minogue resumed work as an actress and appeared in the films Moulin Rouge! (2001), Jack & Diane , and Holy Motors (2012). In 2014, she appeared as a judge on the third series of The Voice UK and The Voice Australia . Her other ventures include product endorsements, children books and fashion.

She was appointed OBE by Prince Charles in 2008. She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture.

[ 14 ] Her father is a fifth generation Australian , and has Irish ancestry, while her mother came from Maesteg , Wales; Carol's mother originated from England . [ 15 ] Jones had lived in Wales until age ten when her mother and father, Millie and Denis Jones, decided to move to Australia for a better living. [ 16 ] Just before Kylie's birth, Ron qualified as an accountant and worked through several jobs while Carol worked as a professional dancer. [ 17 ] Kylie's younger brother, Brendan is a news cameraman in Australia, while her younger sister Dannii Minogue is also a singer and television host. [ 14 ] [ 18 ] The Minogue family frequently moved around various suburbs in Melbourne to sustain their living expenses, which Kylie found unsettling as a child. After the birth of Dannii, the family moved to South Oakleigh. [ 17 ] Because money was tight, Ron worked as an accountant at a family-owned car company and Carol worked as a tea lady at a local hospital. [ 17 ] After moving to Surrey Hills , Melbourne, Minogue attended Studfield Primary School briefly before attending Camberwell Primary School. She went on to Camberwell High School . [ 19 ] During her schooling years, Minogue found it difficult to make friends. [ 20 ] She graduated high school with a high order certificate for Arts and Graphics and English. [ 21 ] Minogue described herself as being of "average intelligence" and "quite modest" during her high school years. [ 21 ] Both Kylie and Dannii began their careers as children on Australian television. [ 14 ] From the age of 11, Kylie appeared in small roles in soap operas including The Sullivans and Skyways . In 1985, she was cast in one of the lead roles in The Henderson Kids . [ 22 ] Minogue took time off school to film The Henderson Kids and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt that she needed the independence to make it into the entertainment industry. [ 23 ] During filming, co-star Nadine Garner labelled Minogue "fragile" after producers yelled at her for forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set. [ 23 ] Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after producer Alan Hardy felt the need for her character to be "written off". [ 24 ] In retrospect, Hardy stated that removing her from the showing "turned out to be the best thing for her". [ 25 ] Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a demo tape for the producers of weekly music programme Young Talent Time , [ 26 ] which featured Dannii as a regular performer. [ 27 ] Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Dannii's success overshadowed Kylie's acting achievements, [ 14 ] until Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, [ 19 ] as Charlene Mitchell , a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20 million British viewers. [ 28 ] Minogue became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one year and was the youngest recipient of the " Gold Logie " as the country's "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote. [ 29 ] 1987–89: Kylie and Enjoy Yourself During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed " I Got You Babe " as a duet with actor John Waters , and "The Loco-Motion" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. [ 30 ] Her first single, " The Locomotion ", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. [ 31 ] She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. [ 32 ] Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman . They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote " I Should Be So Lucky " while she waited outside the studio. [ 33 ] The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. [ 34 ] Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a "Special Achievement Award". [ 35 ] Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. [ 36 ] The album went gold in the United States, and the single, "The Locomotion", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, [ 37 ] and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart . The single " Got to Be Certain " became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. [ 38 ] Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song " Especially for You ", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as "the Singing Budgie " by her detractors over the coming years. [ 39 ] In a review of the album Kylie for AllMusic , Chris True described the tunes as "standard, late-80s ... bubblegum", but added, "her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable". [ 40 ] Minogue's second album Enjoy Yourself was released in October 1989. The album was a success in the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand, Asia and Australia and spawned number one singles " Hand on Your Heart " and " Tears on My Pillow ". [ 36 ] However, it failed to sell well throughout North America and Minogue was dropped by her American record label Geffen Records . She then embarked on her first concert tour, the Enjoy Yourself Tour , in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia in February 1990. She was also one of the featured vocalists on the remake of " Do They Know It's Christmas? ". [ 41 ] Minogue's debut film, The Delinquents was released in December 1989. The movie was poorly received by critics but proved popular with audiences. In the UK it grossed more than £ 200,000, [ 42 ] and in Australia, it was the fourth-highest grossing local film of 1989 and the highest grossing local film of 1990. [ 43 ] 1990–92: Rhythm of Love and Let's Get to It Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was released in November 1990 and was described as "...leaps and bounds more mature..." than her previous albums. [ 44 ] Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona. [ 45 ] The singles from Rhythm of Love sold well in Europe and Australia. [ citation needed ] She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991. Minogue's fourth album, Let's Get to It was released in October 1991 and reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten. [ 36 ] While the first single from the album, " Word Is Out ", became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, [ 36 ] subsequent singles " If You Were with Me Now " and " Give Me Just a Little More Time " both reached the top five. [ 36 ] In support of the album, she embarked on the Let's Get to It Tour in October. She had fulfilled the requirements of her contract with her record company and elected not to renew it. [ 14 ] She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right." [ 46 ] Minogue's first Greatest Hits album was released in August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom [ 36 ] and number three in Australia. [ 47 ] The singles from the album, " What Kind of Fool " and her cover version of Kool & the Gang 's " Celebration " both reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart. [ 36 ] 1993–98: Kylie Minogue and Impossible Princess Minogue's signing with Deconstruction Records in 1993 marked a new phase in her career. Her fifth album Kylie Minogue was released in September 1994 and sold well in Europe and Australia. It was produced by dance music producers the Brothers In Rhythm , namely Dave Seaman and Steve Anderson (musician) , who had previously produced Finer Feelings , her last single with PWL . As of 2015, Anderson continued to be Minogue's musical director . [ 48 ] The lead single, " Confide in Me ", spent four weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart. [ 49 ] The next two singles from the album, " Put Yourself in My Place " and " Where Is the Feeling? ", reached the top twenty on the UK Singles Chart, [ 36 ] while the album peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, [ 36 ] eventually selling 250,000 copies. [ 50 ] During this period, Minogue made a guest appearance as herself in an episode of the comedy The Vicar of Dibley . Director Steven E. de Souza saw Minogue's cover photo in Australia's Who Magazine as one of "The 30 Most Beautiful People in the World" and offered her a role opposite Jean-Claude Van Damme in the film Street Fighter . [ 51 ] The film was a moderate success, earning US$70 million in the US, [ 51 ] but received poor reviews, with The Washington Post ' s Richard Harrington calling Minogue "the worst actress in the English-speaking world". [ 52 ] She had a minor role in the 1996 film Bio-Dome starring Pauly Shore and Stephen Baldwin . [ 53 ] She also appeared in the 1995 short film Hayride to Hell and in the 1997 film Diana & Me . [ citation needed ] The music video for "Where the Wild Roses Grow" (1995) ( left ) was inspired by John Everett Millais ' Ophelia (1851/52) ( right ). In 1995, Minogue collaborated with Australian artist Nick Cave for the song " Where the Wild Roses Grow ". Cave had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing "Better the Devil You Know", saying it contained "one of pop music's most violent and distressing lyrics". [ 54 ] The music video for their song was inspired by John Everett Millais 's painting Ophelia (1851–1852), and showed Minogue as the murdered woman, floating in a pond as a serpent swam over her body. The single received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and reached number two in Australia. [ 55 ] The song won ARIA Awards for "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Release". [ 56 ] Following concert appearances with Cave, Minogue recited the lyrics to "I Should Be So Lucky" as poetry in London's Royal Albert Hall . [ 57 ] By 1997, Minogue was in a relationship with French photographer Stéphane Sednaoui , who encouraged her to develop her creativity. [ 58 ] Inspired by a mutual appreciation of Japanese culture, they created a visual combination of " geisha and manga superheroine" for the photographs taken for Minogue's sixth album Impossible Princess and the video for " German Bold Italic ", Minogue's collaboration with Towa Tei . [ 59 ] She drew inspiration from the music of artists such as Shirley Manson and Garbage , Björk , Tricky and U2 , and Japanese pop musicians such as Pizzicato Five and Towa Tei. [ 60 ] The album featured collaborations with musicians including James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore of the Manic Street Preachers . Mostly a dance album, Minogue countered suggestions that she was trying to become an indie artist . [ 61 ] Acknowledging that she had attempted to escape the perceptions of her that had developed during her early career, she commented that she was ready to "forget the painful criticism" and "accept the past, embrace it, use it". [ 57 ] The music video for " Did It Again " paid homage to her earlier incarnations. [ 62 ] Retitled Kylie Minogue in the UK following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales , it became the lowest-selling album of her career. At the end of the year, a campaign by Virgin Radio stated, "We've done something to improve Kylie's records: we've banned them." [ 19 ] In Australia, the album was a success and spent 35 weeks on the album chart. [ 63 ] Minogue's Intimate and Live tour in 1998 was extended due to demand. [ 64 ] She gave several live performances in Australia, including the 1998 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras , [ 64 ] and the opening ceremonies of Melbourne's Crown Casino , [ 65 ] and Sydney's Fox Studios in 1999 (where she performed Marilyn Monroe 's " Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend ") [ 66 ] as well as a Christmas concert in Dili , East Timor, in association with the United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces . [ 66 ] She played a small role in the Australian-made Molly Ringwald 2000 film Cut . 1999–2004: Light Years , Fever and Body Language William Baker has cited the 1940s " Vargas Girl " pinups of Alberto Vargas as an influence, as demonstrated in the music video for " Spinning Around " (2000) After Minogue parted ways with Deconstruction Records, she performed a duet with the Pet Shop Boys ' on their Nightlife album and spent several months in Barbados performing in Shakespeare's The Tempest . [ 67 ] She then appeared in the film Sample People and recorded a cover version of Russell Morris 's "The Real Thing" for the soundtrack. [ 67 ] In April 1999, she signed with Parlophone Records, [ 68 ] which wanted to re-establish Minogue as a pop artist. [ 69 ] In September 2000, Minogue released her seventh studio album, Light Years . The album was a collection of dance songs, influenced by disco music. It generated strong reviews and was successful throughout Australia, Asia, Europe and New Zealand. [ 70 ] The lead single, " Spinning Around ", became her first number one in the United Kingdom in ten years, and its accompanying video featured Minogue in revealing gold hot pants, which came to be regarded as a "trademark". [ 71 ] [ 72 ] The second single, " On a Night Like This " reached number one in Australia [ 73 ] and number two in the United Kingdom. [ 36 ] " Kids ", a duet with Robbie Williams , also peaked at number two in the United Kingdom. [ 36 ] At the 2000 Sydney Olympics closing ceremony, Minogue performed ABBA 's " Dancing Queen " and her single "On a Night Like This". [ 74 ] She then embarked on the On a Night Like This Tour , which played to sell-out crowds in Australia and the United Kingdom. The tour incorporated Burlesque and theatre and cited the style of Broadway shows such as 42nd Street , films such as Anchors Aweigh , South Pacific , the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals of the 1930s and the live performances of Bette Midler as inspiration. [ 75 ] Minogue was praised for her new material and her reinterpretations of some of her greatest successes. She won a " Mo Award " for Australian live entertainment as "Performer of the Year". [ 76 ] She also appeared in the 2001 film, Moulin Rouge! as "The Green Fairy". [ 77 ] Minogue performing on Money Can't Buy (2003). In October 2001, Minogue released her eighth studio album Fever . The album contained disco elements combined with 1980s electropop and synthpop . [ 78 ] It reached number one in Australia, United Kingdom, and throughout Europe, eventually achieving worldwide sales in excess of eight million. [ 79 ] The album's lead single, " Can't Get You Out of My Head ", became the biggest success of her career, reaching number one in more than forty countries [ 80 ] and selling over 5 million copies . [ 81 ] She won four ARIA Awards including a "Most Outstanding Achievement" award, [ 82 ] and two Brit Awards , for "Best international female solo artist" and "Best international album". [ 83 ] Following extensive airplay by American radio, Capitol Records released the song and the album Fever in the US in 2002. [ 84 ] The album debuted on the Billboard 200 albums chart at number three, [ 85 ] and "Can't Get You out of My Head" reached number seven on the Hot 100. [ 37 ] The subsequent singles " In Your Eyes ", " Love at First Sight " and " Come into My World " were successful throughout the world, and Minogue established a presence in the mainstream North American market, particularly in the club scene. She followed the success of the album by touring the United States with the Jingle Ball festival. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] In April 2002, Minogue embarked on the KylieFever2002 tour which became the biggest production she had put on to date. Later that year, she worked in a voice role on the animated film The Magic Roundabout , which was released in 2005 in Europe. [ 88 ] In 2003, she received a Grammy Award nomination for "Best Dance Recording" for "Love at First Sight", [ 89 ] and the following year won the same award for "Come into My World". [ 90 ] In November 2003, Minogue released her ninth studio album Body Language following an invitation-only concert, titled Money Can't Buy , at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. The album downplayed the disco style and was inspired by 1980s artists such as Scritti Politti , The Human League , Adam and the Ants and Prince , blending their styles with elements of hip hop . [ 91 ] The sales of the album were lower than anticipated after the success of Fever , [ 79 ] [ 84 ] though the first single, " Slow ", was a number-one hit in the United Kingdom and Australia. [ 92 ] Two more singles from the album were released: " Red Blooded Woman " and " Chocolate ". In the US, "Slow" reached number-one on the club chart [ 93 ] and received a Grammy Award nomination in the Best Dance Recording category. [ 89 ] Body Language achieved first week sales of 43,000 and declined significantly in the second week. [ 94 ] In November 2004, Minogue released her second official greatest hits album entitled Ultimate Kylie . The album yielded two singles: " I Believe in You " and " Giving You Up ". "I Believe in You" was later nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of "Best Dance Recording". [ 95 ] 2005–09: Showgirl and X Minogue performing during her Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour , on 2006. In March 2005, Minogue commenced her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour . After performing in Europe, she travelled to Melbourne, where she was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel the tour. [ 96 ] She resumed the tour in November 2006 with a performance in Sydney. Her dance routines had been reworked to accommodate her medical condition, with slower costume changes and longer breaks introduced between sections of the show to conserve her strength. [ 97 ] The media reported that Minogue performed energetically, with the Sydney Morning Herald describing the show as an "extravaganza" and "nothing less than a triumph". [ 98 ] In November 2007, Minogue released her tenth and much-discussed "comeback" album, X . [ 99 ] The electro -styled album included contributions from Guy Chambers , Cathy Dennis , Bloodshy & Avant and Calvin Harris . [ 99 ] The album received some criticism for the triviality of its subject matter in light of Minogue's experiences with breast cancer. X and the lead single, " 2 Hearts " entered at number one on the Australian albums and singles charts respectively. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] In the United Kingdom, X initially attracted lukewarm sales, [ 99 ] although its commercial performance eventually improved. [ 102 ] Follow-up singles from the album, " In My Arms " and " Wow ", both peaked inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the album was nominated at the 2009 Grammy Awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album . [ 103 ] As part of the promotion of her album, Minogue was featured in White Diamond , a documentary filmed during 2006 and 2007 as she resumed her Showgirl Homecoming Tour.

[ 105 ] She co-starred in the 2007 Doctor Who Christmas special episode, " Voyage of the Damned ", as Astrid Peth .

[ 116 ] Containing disco , eurodance and dance-pop elements, [ citation needed ] the album featured new songwriters and producers including Stuart Price as executive producer. Price also contributed to song writing along with Minogue, Calvin Harris , Jake Shears , Nerina Pallot , Pascal Gabriel , Lucas Secon , Keane's Tim Rice-Oxley and Kish Mauve . The album received favourable reviews from most music critics; Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone labelled the album Minogue's "finest work since 1997's underrated Impossible Princess " and Tim Sendra from Allmusic commended Minogue's choice of collaborators and producers, commenting that the album is the "work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection". [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Aphrodite debuted at number-one in the United Kingdom, exactly twenty two years after her first number one hit in the United Kingdom. [ 119 ] The album's lead single, " All the Lovers ," was a success and became her thirty-third top ten single in the United Kingdom, though subsequent singles from the album, " Get Outta My Way ", " Better than Today ", and " Put Your Hands Up ", failed to reach the top ten of the UK Singles Chart.

With a stage set inspired by the birth of the love goddess Aphrodite and Grecian culture and history, it was greeted with positive reviews from critics, who praised the concept and the stage production. [ 125 ] The tour was a commercial success, grossing a total of US$60 million and ranking at number six and twenty-one on the mid year and annual Pollstar Top Concert Tours of 2011 respectively. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] In 2012, Minogue began a year-long celebration for her 25 years in the music industry, which was often called "K25". The anniversary started with her embarking on the Anti Tour in England and Australia, which featured b-sides , demos and rarities from her music catalogue.

In September, she was featured on Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini 's single " Limpido ", which was a number-one hit in Italy and received a nomination for "World's Best Song" at the 2013 World Music Awards . [ 142 ] In the same month, Minogue was hired as a coach for the third series of BBC One 's talent competition The Voice UK , alongside record producer and Black Eyed Peas member, will.i.am , Kaiser Chiefs ' lead singer Ricky Wilson and singer Sir Tom Jones . [ 143 ] [ 144 ] The show opened with 9.35 million views from the UK, a large percentage increase from the second season. It accumulated an estimated 8.10 million viewers on average. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Minogue's judging and personality on the show were singled out for praise. Ed Power from The Daily Telegraph gave the series premiere 3 stars, praising Minogue for being "glamorous, agreeably giggly [and] a card-carrying national treasure". [ 147 ] In November, she was hired as a coach for the third season of The Voice Australia . [ 148 ] Despite favourable reviews, the third season drew an average rating of 1.817. [ citation needed ] Minogue performing on her Kiss Me Once Tour in France (2014) In March 2014, Minogue released her 12th studio album, Kiss Me Once . [ 149 ] The album featured contributions from Sia Furler , Mike Del Rio , Cutfather , Pharrell Williams , MNEK and Ariel Rechtshaid . [ 150 ] It peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the United Kingdom. [ 151 ] [ 152 ] The singles from the album, " Into the Blue " and " I Was Gonna Cancel ", did not chart inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 12 and number 59 respectively. [ 153 ] In August, Minogue performed a seven song set at the closing ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games , donning a custom Jean Paul Gaultier corset. [ 154 ] In September, she embarked on the Kiss Me Once Tour . [ 155 ] In January 2015, Minogue appeared as a guest vocalist on Giorgio Moroder 's single " Right Here, Right Now " [ 156 ] providing her 12th number one hit on the U.S. Dance Chart on April 18, 2015. [ 157 ] In March, Minogue's contract with Parlophone Records ended, leaving her future music releases with Warner Music Group in Australia and New Zealand. [ 158 ] The same month, she parted ways with Roc Nation "to take more control over her career." [ 159 ] In April, Minogue played tech reporter Shauna in a two episode arc on the ABC Family series, Young & Hungry . Minogue also appeared as Susan Riddick in the disaster film San Andreas , released in May and starring Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino . [ 160 ] In September 2015, an extended play with Fernando Garibay titled Kylie + Garibay was released. [ 161 ] Garibay and Giorgio Moroder served as producers for the extended play. [ 162 ] In November, Minogue was a featured artist on the track, " The Other Boys " by Nervo , alongside Jake Shears and Nile Rodgers . This became her thirteenth chart topper on the U.S Dance Chart, lifting her position in the list of artists with the most U.S. Dance Chart number ones to equal 8th alongside Whitney Houston , Enrique Iglesias and Lady Gaga . [ 163 ] In December 2015, Minogue was the guest on BBC Radio 4 's Desert Island Discs . Her choices included " Dancing Queen " by ABBA , " Purple Rain " by Prince and " Need You Tonight " by INXS . [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Minogue released her first Christmas album, Kylie Christmas in November 2015.

Minogue has been known for her soft soprano vocal range, which has been noted as having "a pleasant soft, breathy quality, and the head notes have a warm and versatile timbre." She has a range of approximately 3.5 octaves. [ citation needed ] Dara Hickey reviewed Minogue's studio album Aphrodite and wrote that she is "singing in her highest vocal range ever." [ 170 ] According to Fiona MacDonald from Madison magazine, Kylie "has never shied away from making some brave but questionable artistic decisions". [ 171 ] In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in pop and dance music . However, her signature music has been contemporary disco music. Her first studio albums with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence, with many critics comparing her to American recording artist Madonna . Chris True from Allmusic , reviewed her debut Kylie and found her music "standard late-'80s Stock-Aitken-Waterman bubblegum", however he stated that she presented the most personality of any 1980s recording artist. [ 172 ] He said of her third album Rhythm of Love , from the early 1990s, "The songwriting is stronger, the production dynamic, and Kylie seems more confident vocally." [ 173 ] At the time of her third studio album, "She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one." Chris True stated that during her relationship with Michael Hutchence , "her shedding of the near-virginal façade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music." [ 174 ] From Minogue's work on her sixth studio album, Impossible Princess , her songwriting and musical content began to change. She was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. [ 175 ] She had written lyrics before, but called them "safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that". [ 176 ] The album, in musical genres, varied from her previous efforts as it incorporated " dance-pop " and " trip hop " music. [ 177 ] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said that the album bears a resemblance to Madonna's Ray of Light . He said that she took inspiration from "both the Brit-pop and electronica movements of the mid-'90s", saying that "Impossible Princess is the work of an artist willing to take risks". [ 177 ] Her next effort, Light Years , he said was "worked up by the renaissance of pure dance-pop that was the order of the day at the onset of the 21st century." [ 174 ] Her ninth album Body Language was quite different from her musical experiments in the past as it was a "successful" attempt at broadening her sound with electro and hip-hop for instance. [ 174 ] Incorporating styles of dance music with funk, disco and R&B, [ 178 ] the album was listed on Q ' s "Best Albums of 2003". [ 179 ] Minogue's tenth record X was a move back to her pop roots. In a press interview for the promotion of the album, she stated that the album was "mainly electropop" and was a "celebration for me to be back working." [ 180 ] However, critics said the album did not feature enough "consistency" and Chris True called the tracks "cold, calculated dance-pop numbers." [ 181 ] However, he said her eleventh album Aphrodite "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" and "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit." Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated, "The various producers keep their eyes on the dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny and sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" and found Aphrodite "One of her best, in fact." [ 182 ] Public image Bronze statue of Kylie Minogue at Waterfront City, Melbourne Docklands . Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not "paid her dues" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours . [ 46 ] Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, "If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go." [ 91 ] In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern , notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. [ 183 ] Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair , making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records. [ 184 ] By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. [ 185 ] Her progression from the wholesome " girl next door " to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. [ 185 ] Her "Spinning Around" video led to some media outlets referring to her as "SexKylie", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos. [ 185 ] William Baker described her status as a sex symbol as a "double edged sword", observing that "we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer." [ 186 ] After 20 years as a performer, Minogue was described as a fashion "trend-setter" and a "style icon who constantly reinvents herself". [ 187 ] She has been acknowledged for mounting successful tours and for worldwide record sales of more than 70 million. [ 11 ] [ 188 ] [ 189 ] " Madonna subverts everything for her own gain. I went to see her London show and it was all so dour and humourless. She surpasses even Joan Crawford in terms of megalomania. Which in itself makes her a kind of dark, gay icon ... I love Kylie, she's the anti-Madonna. Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out. She is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it. She is the gay shorthand for joy." Rufus Wainwright , Observer Music Monthly , 2006. [ 190 ] Minogue has been inspired by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. [ 19 ] Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her success with the observation: "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna ... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." [ 19 ] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour , for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe . [ 191 ] Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, [ 190 ] but concluded, "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet ... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." [ 190 ] Rolling Stone commented that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as "an icon to rival Madonna", saying, "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter." [ 192 ] Minogue has said of Madonna, "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done", [ 191 ] and "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that." [ 190 ] Minogue has been declared by media as a sex symbol . [ 193 ] [ 194 ] [ 195 ] [ 196 ] Wax statue of Kylie Minogue at Madame Tussauds in London. In January 2007, Madame Tussauds in London unveiled its fourth waxwork of Minogue; only Queen Elizabeth II has had more models created. [ 197 ] During the same week a bronze cast of her hands was added to Wembley Arena 's "Square of Fame". [ 197 ] On 23 November 2007, a bronze statue of Minogue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands for permanent display. [ 198 ] In March 2010, Minogue was declared by researchers as the "most powerful celebrity in Britain". The study examined how marketers identify celebrity and brand partnerships. Mark Husak, head of Millward Brown's UK media practice, said: "Kylie is widely accepted as an adopted Brit. People know her, like her and she is surrounded by positive buzz". [ 199 ] She was named one of the "100 Hottest Women of All-Time" by Men's Health . [ 200 ] In May 2011, according to the Sunday Times Rich List , Minogue had a net worth of $66 million (£40m). [ 201 ] In April 2015, the list was updated with her estimated earnings of £55 million (AU $106.61 million). [ 202 ] Minogue is regarded as a gay icon, which she has encouraged with comments including "I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits" and "My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me." [ 91 ] Minogue has explained that she first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. She said that she felt "very touched" to have such an "appreciative crowd", and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras . [ 203 ] Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world. [ 204 ] Minogue's sister, Dannii , also has a large gay following and has been regarded as a gay icon. In September 2007, Kylie Minogue was hailed the greatest gay icon of all time by The Sun . [ 205 ] Personal life Health Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, [ 206 ] leading to the postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl – The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival . [ 207 ] Her hospitalisation and treatment in Melbourne resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of support. [ 208 ] As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. [ 209 ] His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi . [ 210 ] [ 211 ] Minogue underwent surgery on 21 May 2005 at Cabrini Hospital in Malvern and commenced chemotherapy treatment soon after. [ 208 ] On 8 July 2005, she made her first public appearance after surgery when she visited a children's cancer ward at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her chemotherapy treatment at the Institut Gustave-Roussy in Villejuif , near Paris. [ 212 ] In December 2005, Minogue released a digital-only single, " Over the Rainbow ", a live recording from her Showgirl tour. Her children's book, The Showgirl Princess , written during her period of convalescence, was published in October 2006, and her perfume, "Darling", was launched in November. [ 213 ] The range was later augmented by eau de toilettes including Pink Sparkle, Couture and Inverse. [ 214 ] On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she discussed her illness and said that her chemotherapy treatment had been like "experiencing a nuclear bomb ". [ 213 ] While appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2008, Minogue said that her cancer had originally been misdiagnosed. She commented, "Because someone is in a white coat and using big medical instruments doesn't necessarily mean they're right", [ 215 ] but later spoke of her respect for the medical profession. [ 216 ] Minogue was acknowledged for the impact she made by publicly discussing her cancer diagnosis and treatment; in May 2008, the French Cultural Minister Christine Albanel said, "Doctors now even go as far as saying there is a "Kylie effect" that encourages young women to have regular checks." [ 108 ] Minogue is hyperglycemic . [ 217 ] She commented in March 2015, "'Sugar is not my friend, I'm hyperglycemic [...]". Minogue follows the controversial paleolithic diet and "loved all these amazing desserts that are made with avocado, almond bake, zucchini... I love it!" [ 217 ] Philanthropy Minogue performing on her Aphrodite: Les Folies Tour , where she continued to tour in Japan after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami had struck (2011). Minogue has been involved in humanitarian support in areas including health research and quality of life. Musically, she has helped fundraise on many occasions. In 1989, she participated in recording " Do They Know It's Christmas? " under the name Band Aid II to help raise money. In early 2010, Minogue along with many other artists (under the name Helping Haiti) recorded a cover version of " Everybody Hurts ". [ 218 ] The single was a fundraiser to help after the 2010 Haiti earthquake , with the proceeds going to both The Sun 's Helping Haiti fund and the Disasters Emergency Committee . [ 219 ] She also spent a week in Thailand after the 2005 tsunami. [ 220 ] During her 2011 Aphrodite World Tour , the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, which was on her itinerary. She declared she would continue to tour there, stating, "I was here to do shows and I chose not to cancel, Why did I choose not to cancel? I thought long and hard about it and it wasn't an easy decision to make." [ 221 ] While she was there, she and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard were star guests at an Australian Embassy fundraiser for the disaster. [ 221 ] In 2008, Minogue pledged her support for a campaign to raise money for abused children, to be donated to the British charities ChildLine and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. According to the source, around $93 million was raised. [ 222 ] She spoke out in relation to the cause, saying: "Finding the courage to tell someone about being abused is one of the most difficult decisions a child will ever have to make." [ 222 ] In 2010 and 2012, she was involved in supporting the AIDS Support Gala, which was held by the American Foundation for Aids Research (Amfar). [ 223 ] Since Minogue's breast cancer diagnosis in 2005, she has been a sponsor and ambassador for the cause. In May 2010, she held a breast cancer campaign for the first time. She later spoke about the cause saying "It means so much to me to be part of this year's campaign for Fashion Targets Breast Cancer. I wholeheartedly support their efforts to raise funds for the vital work undertaken by Breakthrough Breast Cancer." [ 224 ] For the cause, she "posed in a silk sheet emblazoned with the distinctive target logo of Fashion Targets Breast Cancer" for photographer Mario Testino . [ 224 ] In 2010, she celebrated her fifth anniversary of being clear of the disease by hosting a charity concert to raise money for cancer charities and awareness of the condition. [ 225 ] In April 2014, Minogue had launched a new campaign entitled One Note Against Cancer, which is a charity organisation to help cancer research. [ 226 ] Members of the public are asked to donate money by buying a musical note from eBay 0 from Minogue's charity single " Crystallize ". [ citation needed ] Relationships Minogue began a relationship with French actor Olivier Martinez after meeting him at the 2003 Grammy Awards ceremony. They ended their relationship in February 2007, but remained on friendly terms. Minogue was reported to have been "saddened by false [media] accusations of [Martinez's] disloyalty". She defended Martinez, and acknowledged the support he had given during her treatment for breast cancer. [ 227 ] Minogue was in a relationship with model Andrés Velencoso from 2008 to 2013. [ 228 ] In November 2015, Minogue confirmed she was dating British actor Joshua Sasse . [ 229 ] She announced their engagement on 20 February 2016.

[ 239 ] She has sold more than 70 million records worldwide. [ citation needed ] Dino Scatena from smh.co.au wrote that "A quarter of a century ago, a sequence of symbiotic events altered the fabric of Australian popular culture and set in motion the transformation of a 19-year-old soap actor from Melbourne into an international pop icon." [ 240 ] He then stated "Who could have imagined this tiny, unsophisticated star of Neighbours, with the bad '80s perm and questionable vocal ability, would go on to become Australia's single most successful entertainer and a world-renowned style idol?" [ 240 ] Throughout her career, Minogue has been known for reinventing herself in fashion and musical content. Fabulous Magazine labelled her a "Master of Reinvention." [ 241 ] In November 2006, Minogue posed for Vogue Australia , with Larissa Dubecki from The Age labelling her the "Mother of Reinvention" by saying "This unveiling is as cleverly managed as every aspect of her career, and her illness, to date. Like sharks, celebrities cannot remain static; they must keep moving or die. Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities [...]" [ 242 ] Fiona MacDonald from Madison said Kylie was "an icon, one of the handful of singers recognised around the world by her first name alone. And yet despite becoming an international music superstar, style icon and honorary Brit, those two syllables still seem as Australian as the smell of eucalyptus or a barbeque on a hot day." [ 171 ] Minogue at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival Minogue's hits have garned many accolades throughout her career. In January 2012, NME listed her worldwide hit single "Can't Get You Out of My Head" at number 4 on their Greatest Pop Songs in History. [ 243 ] The song was also named the most-played track of the decade. [ 244 ] The song eventually became the 3rd best-selling UK single and the most-played song in the UK in 2001. [ 245 ] As of 2012, "Can't Get You Out of My Head" was the 72nd song featured on UK's Official Top 100 Biggest Selling Singles of All Time. [ 246 ] Her single " Spinning Around " has also been iconic to Minogue's career, mostly due to her iconic hot pants , with critics calling the music video "excellent tabloid fodder" [ 247 ] and a trademark to her career. [ 248 ] Her song " Come into My World " was honoured with a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2004. [ 249 ] Slant Magazine placed the video for "Come into My World" at number 1 on their "Best of the Aughts: Music Videos" list. [ 250 ] In 2007, French avant-garde guitarist Noël Akchoté released So Lucky , featuring solo guitar versions of tunes recorded by Minogue. [ 251 ] Minogue has been recognised with a number of honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. [ 252 ] Birmingham Post said in 2000; "[o]nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney , Christina , Jessica or Mandy , Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop . Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky , spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [ 253 ] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. [ 254 ] [ 255 ] [ 256 ] [ 257 ] She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. [ 258 ] William Baker , co-author of her book Kylie: La La La , talking about her song " Better the Devil You Know ", commented, "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [ 259 ] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set Kylie: The Albums 2000–2010 and stated "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [ 260 ] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards , she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame . [ citation needed ] Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. [ citation needed ] In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls.

[ 261 ] American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga thanked her on Twitter, citing her as "a supportive female." [ 262 ] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as "inspirational" when she too was diagnosed with cancer.

To date, Kylie has spent 217 weeks on the singles charts, notching up 25 Top 20 hits including four number ones.
