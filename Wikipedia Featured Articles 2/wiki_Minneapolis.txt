[ 1 ] As of 2016, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States with 407,207 residents. [ 2 ] Minneapolis and Saint Paul anchor the second-largest economic center in the Midwest , behind Chicago . [ 5 ] Minneapolis lies on both banks of the Mississippi River , just north of the river's confluence with the Minnesota River , and adjoins Saint Paul, the state's capital. The city is abundantly rich in water, with twenty lakes and wetlands, the Mississippi River, creeks and waterfalls, many connected by parkways in the Chain of Lakes and the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway . It was once the world's flour milling capital and a hub for timber, and today is the primary business center between Chicago and Seattle , with Minneapolis proper containing America's fifth-highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] As an integral link to the global economy, Minneapolis is categorized as a global city . [ 8 ] Minneapolis' name is attributed to Charles Hoag , the city's first schoolteacher, who combined mni , a Dakota Sioux word for water, and polis , the Greek word for city.

[ 11 ] Loading flour , Pillsbury , 1939 Dakota Sioux were the region's sole residents until French explorers arrived around 1680. Nearby Fort Snelling , built in 1819 by the United States Army , spurred growth in the area. The United States government pressed the Mdewakanton band of the Dakota to sell their land, allowing people arriving from the east to settle there. The Minnesota Territorial Legislature authorized present-day Minneapolis as a town on the Mississippi's west bank in 1856. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867, the year rail service began between Minneapolis and Chicago. It later joined with the east-bank city of St. Anthony in 1872. [ 12 ] Waterpower; lumber and flour milling [ edit ] Minneapolis grew up around Saint Anthony Falls , the highest waterfall on the Mississippi River . In early years, forests in northern Minnesota were the source of a lumber industry that operated seventeen sawmills on power from the waterfall. By 1871, the west river bank had twenty-three businesses including flour mills, woolen mills, iron works, a railroad machine shop, and mills for cotton, paper, sashes, and planing wood. [ 13 ] Due to occupational hazards of milling, six local sources of artificial limbs were competing in the prosthetics business by the 1890s. [ 14 ] The farmers of the Great Plains grew grain that was shipped by rail to the city's thirty-four flour mills . Millers have used hydropower elsewhere since the 1st century B.C., [ 15 ] but the results in Minneapolis between 1880 and 1930 were so remarkable the city has been described as "the greatest direct-drive waterpower center the world has ever seen." [ 16 ] A father of modern milling in America and founder of what became General Mills , Cadwallader C. Washburn converted his business from gristmills to truly revolutionary technology including "gradual reduction" processing by steel and porcelain roller mills which were capable of producing premium-quality pure white flour very quickly. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Some ideas were developed by William Dixon Gray [ 19 ] and some through industrial espionage from the Hungarians by William de la Barre . [ 18 ] Charles A. Pillsbury and C.A. Pillsbury Company across the river were barely a step behind, hiring Washburn employees to immediately implement the new methods. [ 18 ] The hard red spring wheat that grows in Minnesota became valuable ($.50 profit per barrel in 1871 increased to $4.50 in 1874 [ 17 ] ) and Minnesota "patent" flour was recognized at the time as the best in the world. [ 18 ] Not until later did consumers discover the value in the bran (which contains wheat's vitamins, minerals and fiber) that "Minneapolis... millers routinely dumped" into the Mississippi. [ 20 ] Millers cultivated relationships with academic scientists especially at the University of Minnesota . Those scientists backed them politically on many issues, for example during the early 20th century, when health advocates in the nascent field of nutrition criticized the flour "bleaching" process. [ 18 ] At peak production, a single mill at Washburn-Crosby made enough flour for 12 million loaves of bread each day, [ 21 ] and by 1900, 14.1 percent of America's grain was milled in Minneapolis. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Further, by 1895 through the efforts of silent partner William Hood Dunwoody , Washburn-Crosby exported four million barrels of flour a year to the United Kingdom, [ 22 ] and when exports reached their peak in 1900, about one third of all flour milled in Minneapolis was shipped overseas. [ 22 ] Corruption, social movements, urban renewal [ edit ] Known initially as a kindly physician, Doc Ames headed the city into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900. [ 23 ] The gangster Kid Cann was famous for bribery and intimidation during the 1930s and 1940s. [ 24 ] The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers. [ 25 ] When the country's fortunes turned during the Great Depression , the violent Teamsters Strike of 1934 resulted in laws acknowledging workers' rights. [ 26 ] A lifelong civil rights activist and union supporter, mayor Hubert Humphrey helped the city establish fair employment practices and a human relations council that interceded on behalf of minorities by 1946. [ 27 ] In the 1950s, about 1.6% of the population of Minneapolis was nonwhite. [ 28 ] Minneapolis contended with white supremacy , participated in desegregation and the African-American civil rights movement , and in 1968 was the birthplace of the American Indian Movement . [ 29 ] Minneapolis was a "particularly virulent" site of anti-semitism until 1950. A hate group recruited members in the city and held meetings there around 1936 to 1938. The Jewish Free Employment Bureau tried to help victims of economic discrimination with limited success. Formed in 1948, the nonsectarian Mount Sinai Hospital was a place where Jewish physicians and health professionals could practice. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] During the 1950s and 1960s, as part of urban renewal , the city razed about 200 buildings across 25 city blocks (roughly 40% of downtown), destroying the Gateway District and many buildings with notable architecture including the Metropolitan Building . Efforts to save the building failed but are credited with sparking interest in (but not always succeeding in) historic preservation in the state. [ 32 ] Mississippi riverfront and Saint Anthony Falls in 1915. At left, Pillsbury , power plants and the Stone Arch Bridge . Today the Minnesota Historical Society 's Mill City Museum is in the Washburn "A" Mill , across the river just to the left of the falls. At center left are Northwestern Consolidated mills. The tall building is Minneapolis City Hall . In the right foreground are Nicollet Island and the Hennepin Avenue Bridge . Geography and climate [ edit ] Main articles: Climate of Minnesota , Climate of the Twin Cities and Geography of Minneapolis View of downtown Minneapolis across Lake Calhoun ( Bde Maka Ska ) [ 33 ] The history and economic growth of Minneapolis are tied to water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which was brought to the region during the last ice age ten thousand years ago. Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis. [ 34 ] Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz , torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river's only waterfall, Saint Anthony Falls , important to the early settlers of Minneapolis. [ 35 ] Lying on an artesian aquifer [ 6 ] and flat terrain, Minneapolis has a total area of 58.4 square miles (151.3 km 2 ) and of this 6% is water. [ 36 ] Water supply is managed by four watershed districts that correspond to the Mississippi and the city's three creeks . [ 37 ] Twelve lakes, three large ponds, and five unnamed wetlands are within Minneapolis. [ 37 ] The city center is located at 45° N latitude . [ 38 ] The city's lowest elevation of 686 feet (209 m) is near where Minnehaha Creek meets the Mississippi River. The site of the Prospect Park Water Tower is often cited as the city's highest point [ 39 ] and a placard in Deming Heights Park denotes the highest elevation. A spot at 974 feet (297 m) in or near Waite Park in Northeast Minneapolis , however, is corroborated by Google Earth as the highest ground. Cityscape [ edit ] Panorama of the Minneapolis skyline Climate [ edit ] Lake Harriet frozen and snow-covered in winter Minneapolis has a humid continental climate typical of the Upper Midwest . Winters are cold and snowy, while summers are warm with moderate to high humidity. According to NOAA, Minneapolis's annual average for sunshine is 58%. [ 40 ] On the Köppen climate classification , Minneapolis falls in the humid continental climate zone ( Dfa ) and is situated in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a/4b. [ 41 ] As is typical in a continental climate, the difference between average temperatures in the coldest winter month and the warmest summer month is great: 60.1 °F (33.4 °C). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The highest recorded temperature was 108 °F (42 °C) in July 1936 while the lowest was −41 °F (−41 °C) in January 1888. The snowiest winter of record was 1983–84, when 98.4 inches (250 cm) of snow fell.

Over one-fifth of the population of Minneapolis is of German descent. White Americans make up about three-fifths of Minneapolis's population. This community is predominantly of German and Scandinavian descent. There are 82,870 German Americans in the city, making up over one-fifth (23.1%) of the population. The Scandinavian-American population is primarily Norwegian and Swedish . There are 39,103 Norwegian Americans, making up 10.9% of the population; there are 30,349 Swedish Americans, making up 8.5% of the city's population. Danish Americans are not nearly as numerous; there are 4,434 Danish Americans, making up only 1.3% of the population. Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish Americans together make up 20.7% of the population. This means that ethnic Germans and Scandinavians together make up 43.8% of Minneapolis's population, and make up the majority of Minneapolis's non-Hispanic white population. Other significant European groups in the city include those of Irish (11.3%), English (7.0%), Polish (3.9%), French (3.5%) and Italian (2.3%) descent. American Swedish Institute . Immigrants from Scandinavia arrived beginning in the 1860s. The city's majority racial group, White people , declined as a percentage of the population from 92.8% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] There are 10,711 individuals who identify as multiracial in Minneapolis. People of black and white ancestry number at 3,551, and make up 1.0% of the population. People of white and Native American ancestry number at 2,319, and make up 0.6% of the population. Those of white and Asian ancestry number at 1,871, and make up 0.5% of the population. Lastly, people of black and Native American ancestry number at 885, and make up 0.2% of Minneapolis's population. Dakota tribes, mostly the Mdewakanton , as early as the 16th century were known as permanent settlers near their sacred site of St. Anthony Falls. [ 12 ] New settlers arrived during the 1850s and 1860s in Minneapolis from New England , New York , and Canada, and during the mid-1860s, immigrants from Finland and Scandinavians (from Sweden, Norway and Denmark) began to call the city home. Migrant workers from Mexico and Latin America also interspersed. [ 56 ] Later, immigrants came from Germany, Italy, Greece, Poland, and Southern and Eastern Europe. These immigrants tended to settle in the Northeast neighborhood, which still retains an ethnic flavor and is particularly known for its Polish community. Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe began arriving in the 1880s and settled primarily on the north side of the city before moving in large numbers to the western suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. [ 57 ] Asians came from China, the Philippines , Japan, and Korea . Two groups came for a short while during U.S. government relocations: Japanese during the 1940s, and Native Americans during the 1950s. From 1970 onward, Asians arrived from Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , and Thailand . Beginning in the 1990s, a large Latino population arrived, along with immigrants from the Horn of Africa , especially Somalia . [ 58 ] The metropolitan area is an immigrant gateway which had a 127% increase in foreign-born residents between 1990 and 2000. [ 59 ] U.S. Census Bureau estimates in the year 2014 show the population of Minneapolis to be 407,207, a 6.5% increase since the 2010 census. The population grew until 1950 when the census peaked at 521,718, and then declined as people moved to the suburbs until about 1990. Among U.S. cities as of 2006, Minneapolis has the fourth-highest percentage of gay, lesbian, or bisexual people in the adult population, with 12.5% (behind San Francisco, and slightly behind both Seattle and Atlanta ). [ 60 ] [ 61 ] In 2012, The Advocate named Minneapolis the seventh gayest city in America. [ 62 ] In 2013, the city was among 25 U.S. cities to receive the highest possible score from the Human Rights Campaign , signifying its support for LGBT residents. [ 63 ] Racial and ethnic minorities lag behind white counterparts in education, with 15.0% of blacks and 13.0% of Hispanics holding bachelor's degrees compared to 42.0% of the white population. The standard of living is on the rise, with incomes among the highest in the Midwest , but median household income among minorities is below that of whites by over $17,000. Regionally, home ownership among minority residents is half that of whites though Asian home ownership has doubled. In 2000, the poverty rate for whites was 4.2%; for blacks it was 26.2%; for Asians, 19.1%; Native Americans, 23.2%; and Hispanics, 18.1%. [ 59 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Religion [ edit ] The Baroque -style Basilica of Saint Mary by Emmanuel Louis Masqueray [ 66 ] According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center , 70% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians , with 46% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant , and 21% professing Roman Catholic beliefs [ 67 ] [ 68 ] while 23% claim no religious affiliation . The same study says that other religions (including Judaism , Buddhism , Islam , and Hinduism ) collectively make up about 5% of the population. The Dakota people, the original inhabitants of the area where Minneapolis now stands, believed in the Great Spirit and were surprised that not all European settlers were religious. [ 69 ] Over fifty denominations and religions and some well known churches have since been established in Minneapolis. Those who arrived from New England were for the most part Christian Protestants , Quakers , and Universalists . [ 69 ] The oldest continuously used church in the city, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in the Nicollet Island/East Bank neighborhood, was built in 1856 by Universalists and soon afterward was acquired by a French Catholic congregation. [ 70 ] The first Jewish congregation in Minneapolis was formed in 1878 as Shaarai Tov (though it has been known since 1920 as Temple Israel ); in 1928, it built the synagogue in East Isles . [ 57 ] St. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral was founded in 1887, opened a missionary school in 1897 and in 1905 created the first Russian Orthodox seminary in the U.S. [ 71 ] Edwin Hawley Hewitt designed both St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral and Hennepin Avenue United Methodist Church on Hennepin Avenue just south of downtown. [ 72 ] The first basilica in the United States, and Co-Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis , the Basilica of Saint Mary near Loring Park was named by Pope Pius XI in 1926. [ 69 ] Christ Church Lutheran by Eliel and Eero Saarinen is considered an architectural masterpiece. [ 66 ] The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association , Decision magazine, and World Wide Pictures film and television distribution were headquartered in Minneapolis between the late 1940s into the 2000s. [ 73 ] Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye met while attending the Pentecostal North Central University and began a television ministry that by the 1980s reached 13.5 million households. [ 74 ] Today, Mount Olivet Lutheran Church in southwest Minneapolis with about 6,000 attendees is the nation's second-largest Lutheran congregation. [ 75 ] Christ Church Lutheran in the Longfellow neighborhood is among the finest work by architect Eliel Saarinen . The congregation later added an education building designed by his son Eero Saarinen . [ 76 ] Religions outside the Judeo-Christian mainstream also have a home in the city. During the mid-to-late 1950s, members of the Nation of Islam created a temple in north Minneapolis, [ 77 ] and the first mosque was built in 1967. [ 78 ] In 1972 a relief agency resettled the first Shi'a Muslim family from Uganda . By 2004, between 20,000 and 30,000 Somali Muslims made the city their home. [ 79 ] In 1972, Dainin Katagiri was invited from California to Minneapolis—by one account, a place he thought nobody else would want to go—where he founded a lineage which today includes three Sōtō Zen centers among the city's nearly 20 Buddhist and meditation centers. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Atheists For Human Rights has its headquarters in the Shingle Creek neighborhood in a geodesic dome . [ 82 ] Minneapolis has had a chartered local body of Ordo Templi Orientis since 1994. [ 83 ] Economy [ edit ] See also: Economy of Minnesota White U.S. Bancorp towers reflected in the Capella Tower The Minneapolis–St. Paul area is the second largest economic center in the Midwest , behind Chicago . The economy of Minneapolis today is based in commerce, finance, rail and trucking services, health care, and industry. Smaller components are in publishing, milling, food processing, graphic arts, insurance, education, and high technology. Industry produces metal and automotive products, chemical and agricultural products, electronics, computers, precision medical instruments and devices, plastics, and machinery. [ 84 ] The city at one time produced farm implements. [ 85 ] Five Fortune 500 corporations make their headquarters within the city limits of Minneapolis: Target , U.S. Bancorp , Xcel Energy , Ameriprise Financial and Thrivent Financial . [ 86 ] As of 2015 the city's largest employers downtown are Target , Wells Fargo , HCMC , Hennepin County , Ameriprise, U.S. Bancorp, Xcel Energy , City of Minneapolis, RBC Wealth Management , the Star Tribune , Capella Education Company , Thrivent, CenturyLink , ABM Industries , and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis . [ 87 ] Target Corporation 's 361,000 employees operate 1,801 stores in all U.S. states except Vermont. [ 88 ] Foreign companies with U.S. offices in Minneapolis include Accenture , Canadian Pacific , Coloplast , [ 89 ] RBC [ 90 ] and Voya Financial (a US company formerly part of ING Group ). [ 91 ] Availability of Wi-Fi , transportation solutions, medical trials, university research and development expenditures, advanced degrees held by the work force, and energy conservation are so far above the national average that in 2005, Popular Science named Minneapolis the "Top Tech City" in the U.S. [ 92 ] The Twin Cities was ranked as the country's second best city in a 2006 Kiplinger's poll of Smart Places to Live and Minneapolis was one of the Seven Cool Cities for young professionals. [ 93 ] The Twin Cities contribute 63.8% of the gross state product of Minnesota. Measured by gross metropolitan product per resident ($62,054), Minneapolis is the fifteenth richest city in the U.S. [ 94 ] The area's $199.6 billion gross metropolitan product and its per capita personal income rank thirteenth in the U.S. [ 95 ] Recovering from the nation's recession in 2000, personal income grew 3.8% in 2005, though it was behind the national average of 5%. The city returned to peak employment during the fourth quarter of that year. [ 96 ] The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis , serves Minnesota, Montana , North and South Dakota , and parts of Wisconsin and Michigan .

[ 208 ] While violent crime dropped (from 6,374 in 2006 to 3,720 in 2011 [ 208 ] ), homicides rose by 105% [ 209 ] and rape was at the highest rate among large cities. [ 210 ] U.S. News & World Report said in 2011 that Minneapolis tied with Cleveland, Ohio as the 10th most dangerous city in the United States. [ 211 ] Janeé Harteau was confirmed as the new police chief in 2012. A member of the force since 1987, Harteau, who was nominated by mayor R.T. Rybak and is the city's first female and first openly gay police chief, already served as deputy chief, inspector, and patrol bureau commander. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] The City Council passed a resolution in March 2015 making fossil fuel divestment city policy. [ 214 ] With encouragement from Mayor Hodges, Minneapolis joined seventeen cities worldwide in the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance . The city's climate plan is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 15 percent in 2015 "compared to 2006 levels, 30 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2050". [ 215 ] Education [ edit ] Main articles: Minneapolis Public Library , Minneapolis Public Schools , Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System and University of Minnesota Statue of Minerva in the central Hennepin County Library downtown Minneapolis Public Schools enroll 36,370 students in public primary and secondary schools. The district administers about 100 public schools including 45 elementary schools , seven middle schools , seven high schools , eight special education schools, eight alternative schools , 19 contract alternative schools, and five charter schools . With authority granted by the state legislature, the school board makes policy, selects the superintendent, and oversees the district's budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities. Students speak 90 different languages at home and most school communications are printed in English, Hmong , Spanish, and Somali . [ 216 ] About 44% of students in the Minneapolis Public School system graduate, which ranks the 6th worst out of the nation's 50 largest cities. [ 217 ] Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute. [ 218 ] Besides public schools, the city is home to more than 20 private schools and academies and about 20 additional charter schools. [ 219 ] Minneapolis' collegiate scene is dominated by the main campus of the University of Minnesota where more than 50,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students attend 20 colleges, schools, and institutes. [ 220 ] The graduate school programs ranked highest in 2007 were counseling and personnel services, chemical engineering, psychology, macroeconomics, applied mathematics and non-profit management. [ 221 ] A Big Ten school and home of the Golden Gophers, the University of Minnesota is the fourth largest campus among U.S. public 4-year universities in terms of enrollment. [ 222 ] As of 2010, the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis East Bank campus above) has the fourth-largest student body of U.S. public 4-year universities.

[ 223 ] The Hennepin County Library system began to operate the city's public libraries in 2008. [ 224 ] The Minneapolis Public Library , founded by T. B. Walker in 1885, [ 225 ] faced a severe budget shortfall for 2007, and was forced to temporarily close three of its neighborhood libraries. [ 226 ] The new downtown Central Library designed by César Pelli opened in 2006. [ 227 ] Ten special collections hold over 25,000 books and resources for researchers, including the Minneapolis Collection and the Minneapolis Photo Collection. [ 228 ] At recent count 1,696,453 items in the system are used annually and the library answers over 500,000 research and fact-finding questions each year. [ 229 ] Media [ edit ] WCCO-TV on the Nicollet Mall Five major newspapers are published in Minneapolis: Star Tribune , Finance and Commerce , Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder , the university's The Minnesota Daily and MinnPost.com . Other publications are the City Pages weekly, the Mpls.St.Paul and Minnesota Monthly monthlies, and Utne magazine. [ 230 ] In 2008 readers of online news also used The UpTake , Minnesota Independent , Twin Cities Daily Planet , Downtown Journal , Cursor , MNSpeak and about fifteen other sites. [ 231 ] Minneapolis has a mix of radio stations and healthy listener support for public radio. In the commercial market three radio broadcasting companies iHeartMedia (formerly Clear Channel), CBS Radio , and Cumulus Media operate the majority of the radio stations in the market. Listeners support three Minnesota Public Radio non-profit stations and two community non-profit stations, the Minneapolis Public Schools and the University of Minnesota each operate a station, and religious organizations run four stations. [ 232 ] KFAI radio with studios in Cedar-Riverside is a community station.

[ 246 ] [ 247 ] The 1970s CBS situation comedy fictionally based in Minneapolis, The Mary Tyler Moore Show , won three Golden Globes and 31 Emmy Awards . [ 248 ] Infrastructure [ edit ] Transportation [ edit ] Main articles: Transportation in Minnesota , METRO (Minnesota) and I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge METRO Blue Line LRT downtown at Government Plaza Half of Minneapolis–Saint Paul residents work in the city where they live. [ 249 ] Most residents drive cars but 60% of the 160,000 people working downtown commute by means other than a single person per auto. [ 250 ] Alternative transportation is encouraged. The Metropolitan Council 's Metro Transit , which operates the light rail system and most of the city's buses, provides free travel vouchers through the Guaranteed Ride Home program to allay fears that commuters might otherwise be occasionally stranded if, for example, they work late hours. [ 251 ] On January 1, 2011, the city's limit of 343 taxis was lifted. [ 252 ] Minneapolis currently has two light rail lines and one commuter rail line. The METRO Blue Line LRT (formerly the Hiawatha Line [ 253 ] ) serves 34,000 riders daily and connects the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport and Mall of America in Bloomington to downtown. Most of the line runs at surface level, although parts of the line run on elevated tracks (including the Franklin Avenue and Lake Street/Midtown stations) and approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) of the line runs underground, including the Lindbergh terminal subway station at the airport. Minneapolis' second [ 254 ] light rail line, the METRO Green Line shares stations with the Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis, and then at the Downtown East station , travels east through the University of Minnesota , and then along University Avenue into downtown Saint Paul . Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. The third line, the Southwest Line (Green Line extension), will connect downtown Minneapolis with the southwestern suburb of Eden Prairie. Completion is expected sometime in the late 2010s. [ 255 ] A northwest LRT is planned along Bottineau Boulevard (Blue Line extension) from downtown to Brooklyn Park and Maple Grove . The 40-mile Northstar Commuter rail , which runs from Big Lake through the northern suburbs and terminates at the multi-modal transit station at Target Field , opened on November 16, 2009. [ 256 ] It utilizes existing railroad tracks and serves 2,600 daily commuters. [ 257 ] Bike rack on the Blue Line Minneapolis ranks 27th in the nation for the highest percentage of commuters by bicycle, [ 258 ] and was editorialized as the top bicycling city in "Bicycling's Top 50" ranking in 2010. [ 259 ] Ten thousand cyclists use the bike lanes in the city each day, and many ride in the winter. The Public Works Department expanded the bicycle trail system from the Grand Rounds to 56 miles (90 km) of off-street commuter trails including the Midtown Greenway , the Light Rail Trail, Kenilworth Trail, Cedar Lake Trail and the West River Parkway Trail along the Mississippi. Minneapolis also has 34 miles (54 km) of dedicated bike lanes on city streets and encourages cycling by equipping transit buses with bike racks and by providing online bicycle maps. [ 260 ] Many of these trails and bridges, such as the Stone Arch Bridge , were former railroad lines that have now been converted for bicycles and pedestrians. [ 261 ] In 2007 citing the city's bicycle lanes, buses and LRT, Forbes identified Minneapolis the world's fifth cleanest city. [ 262 ] In 2010, Nice Ride Minnesota launched with 65 kiosks for bicycle sharing, [ 263 ] and 19 pedicabs were operating downtown. [ 264 ] Nice Ride plans to expand in 2013 to 170 stations in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and expects to add 17 more in 2014. [ 265 ] A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Minneapolis the ninth most walkable of 50 largest cities in the United States. [ 266 ] Seven miles (11 km) of enclosed pedestrian bridges called skyways , the Minneapolis Skyway System , link eighty city blocks downtown. Second floor restaurants and retailers connected to these passageways are open on weekdays. [ 267 ] Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP) sits on 3,400 acres (1,400 ha) [ 268 ] on the southeast border of the city between Minnesota State Highway 5 , Interstate 494 , Minnesota State Highway 77 , and Minnesota State Highway 62 . The airport serves three international, 12 domestic, seven charter and four regional carriers [ 269 ] and is a hub and home base for Delta Air Lines , Mesaba Airlines , and Sun Country Airlines . [ 270 ] Health and utilities [ edit ] Minneapolis DID Ambassador Minneapolis has seven hospitals, four ranked among America's best by U.S. News & World Report — Abbott Northwestern Hospital (part of Allina ), Children's Hospitals and Clinics , Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) and the University of Minnesota Medical Center . [ 271 ] Minneapolis VA Medical Center , Shriners Hospitals for Children and Allina's Phillips Eye Institute also serve the city. [ 272 ] The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota is a 75-minute drive away. [ 273 ] Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) A snow emergency Cardiac surgery was developed at the university's Variety Club Hospital, where by 1957, more than 200 patients had survived open-heart operations, many of them children. Working with surgeon C. Walton Lillehei , Medtronic began to build portable and implantable cardiac pacemakers about this time. [ 274 ] HCMC opened in 1887 as City Hospital and was also known as General Hospital. [ 31 ] A public teaching hospital and Level I trauma center , the HCMC safety net sees more than 350,000 clinic visits and 97,000 emergency room visits each year and in 2012 provided about 18% of the uncompensated care given in Minnesota. [ 275 ] Funded in part by assessments on commercial properties, in 2009 Ambassadors of the Minneapolis Downtown Improvement District (DID) began working on 120 blocks of downtown to improve its cleanliness, friendliness and acceptability of behavior. They are employees of Block by Block , a company in Nashville, Tennessee that serves 46 U.S. cities. [ 276 ] Utility providers are regulated monopolies : Xcel Energy supplies electricity, CenterPoint Energy supplies gas, CenturyLink provides landline telephone service, and Comcast provides cable service. [ 277 ] In 2007 citywide wireless internet coverage began, provided for 10 years by US Internet of Minnetonka to residents for about $20 per month and to businesses for $30. [ 278 ] The Minneapolis Wi-Fi network earns $1.2 million annual profit and as of 2010 has about 20,000 customers. [ 279 ] The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. [ 277 ] After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency , the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 miles (1,609 km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7 km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.
