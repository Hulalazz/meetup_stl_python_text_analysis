Stanley Green Stanley Green in Oxford Street , 1977 Born ( 1915-02-22 ) 22 February 1915 Harringay , London Died 4 December 1993 ( 1993-12-04 ) (aged 78) Northolt , London [ 1 ] Known for Dietary reform Parent(s) Richard Green May Green Military career Allegiance United Kingdom Service/branch Royal Navy Years of service 1938–1945 Battles/wars World War II Stanley Owen Green (22 February 1915 – 4 December 1993), known as the Protein Man , was a human billboard who became a well-known figure in central London in the latter half of the 20th century. [ 2 ] Green patrolled Oxford Street in the West End for 25 years, from 1968 until 1993, with a placard recommending " protein wisdom", a low-protein diet that he said would dampen the libido and make people kinder. His 14-page pamphlet, Eight Passion Proteins with Care , sold 87,000 copies over 20 years. [ 1 ] Green's campaign to suppress desire, as one commentator called it, was not always popular, but he became one of London's much-loved eccentrics. The Sunday Times interviewed him in 1985, and his "less passion from less protein" slogan was used by the fashion house Red or Dead . [ 3 ] When he died at the age of 78, the Daily Telegraph , Guardian and Times published his obituary, and the Museum of London added his pamphlets and placards to their collection. In 2006 his biography was included in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography .

He attended Wood Green School before joining the Royal Navy in 1938. [ 1 ] Philip Carter writes in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that Green's time with the Navy affected him deeply. He was shocked by the obsession with sex. [ 1 ] "I was astonished when things were said quite openly – what a husband would say to his wife when home on leave", he told the Sunday Times "A Life in the Day" column in 1985. "I've always been a moral sort of person." [ 4 ] After leaving the Navy in September 1945, Green worked for the Fine Art Society . In March 1946, Carter writes, he failed the entrance exam for the University of London, then worked for Selfridges and the civil service, and as a storeman for Ealing Borough Council. [ 1 ] He said that he had lost jobs twice because he had refused to be dishonest. [ 5 ] In 1962 he held a job with the post office, then worked as a self-employed gardener until 1968 when he began his anti-protein campaign. He lived with his parents until they died, his father in 1966 and his mother the following year, after which he was given a council flat in Haydock Green, Northolt , north London. [ 1 ] His mission [ edit ] On the streets [ edit ] Oxford Street, 1974 Green began his mission in June 1968, at the age of 53, initially in Harrow on Saturdays, becoming a full-time human billboard six months later on Oxford Street. He cycled there from Northolt with a sandwich board attached to the bicycle, a journey of 12 miles (19 km) that could take up to two hours, until he was given a bus pass when he turned 65. [ 4 ] He rose early, and after porridge for breakfast made bread that would rise while he was on patrol, ready for his evening meal. Otherwise his diet consisted of steamed vegetables and pulses, and a pound of apples a day. Lunch was prepared on a Bunsen burner and eaten at 2:30 in a "warm and secret place" near Oxford Street. [ 4 ] From Monday to Saturday he walked up and down the street until 6:30 pm, reduced to four days a week from 1985. Saturday evenings were spent with the cinema crowds in Leicester Square . [ 1 ] He would to go to bed at 12:30 am after saying a prayer. "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the Sunday Times . "It is a sort of acknowledgment of God, just in case there happens to be one." [ 4 ] Peter Ackroyd wrote in London: The Biography that Green was for the most part ignored, becoming "a poignant symbol of the city's incuriosity and forgetfulness". [ 6 ] He was arrested for public obstruction twice, in 1980 and 1985. [ 1 ] "The injustice of it upsets me", he said, "because I'm doing such a good job". He took to wearing overalls to protect himself from spit, several times finding it on his hat at the end of the day. [ 4 ] Writing [ edit ] External media "Stanley Green" (2013) by Martin Gordon (song) Green's Adana Eight-Five printing press , Gunnersbury Museum Sundays were spent at home producing Eight Passion Proteins on his printing press. Waldemar Januszczak described it as worthy of Heath Robinson , who was known for his cartoons of ancient contraptions. [ 7 ] The racket caused trouble between Green and his neighbours. [ 8 ] Noted for its eccentric typography, Eight Passion Proteins went through 52 editions between 1973 and 1993. [ 9 ] Green sold 20 copies on weekdays and up to 50 on Saturdays (for 10 pence in 1980 and 12 pence 13 years later), a total of 87,000 copies by February 1993, according to Carter. He sent copies to those in the public eye, including five British prime ministers, the Prince of Wales , the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Pope Paul VI . [ 1 ] The booklet argued that "those who do not have to work hard with their limbs, and those who are inclined to sit about" will "store up their protein for passion", making retirement, for example, a period of increased passion and marital discord. [ 10 ] He left several unpublished manuscripts, including a novel, Behind the Veil: More than Just a Tale ; a 67-page text called Passion and Protein ; and a 392-page version of Eight Passion Proteins , which, Carter writes, was rejected by Oxford University Press in 1971. [ 1 ] Posthumous recognition [ edit ] Part of the Stanley Green exhibit at the Museum of London , 2010 Green enjoyed his local fame. The Sunday Times interviewed him in 1985 for its "A Life in the Day" feature, and some of his slogans, including "less passion from less protein" were used on dresses and t-shirts by the London fashion house Red or Dead . [ 11 ] When he died in 1993 at the age of 78, the Daily Telegraph , Guardian and Times all published obituaries. His letters, diaries, pamphlets and placards were given to the Museum of London; other artefacts went to the Gunnersbury Park Museum . [ 12 ] His printing press was featured in Cornelia Parker 's exhibition "The Maybe" (1995) at the Serpentine Gallery , along with Robert Maxwell 's shoelaces, one of Winston Churchill 's cigars and Tilda Swinton in a glass box. [ 7 ] In 2006 he was given an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. [ 2 ] Two decades after his death Green was still remembered by writers and bloggers, fondly for the most part, although not invariably so. Artist Alun Rowlands' documentary fiction, 3 Communiqués (2007), portrayed him as trawling the streets of London, "campaigning for the suppression of desire". [ 13 ] Musician Martin Gordon included a track about Green on his 2013 album, Include Me Out .
