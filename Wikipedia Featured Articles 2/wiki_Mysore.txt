Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city, which is also the headquarters of the Mysore district and the Mysore division . Mysore is the cleanest city in India. Mysore served as the capital city of Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries, from 1399 until 1947. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty , except for a brief period in the late 18th century when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. Patrons of art and culture, the Wodeyars contributed significantly to the cultural growth of the city. The cultural ambience and achievements of Mysore earned it the sobriquet Cultural capital of South Karnataka . Mysore is noted for its palaces, including the Mysore Palace , and for the festivities that take place during the Dasara festival when the city receives a large number of tourists. It lends its name to the Mysore style of painting , the sweet dish Mysore Pak , the Mysore Peta (a traditional silk turban) and the garment known as the Mysore silk saree . Tourism is the major industry, while information technology has emerged as a major employer alongside the traditional industries. Mysore depends on rail and bus transport for inter-city connections. The city was the location of the first private radio station in India. Mysore houses Mysore University , which has produced several notable authors, particularly in the field of Kannada literature . Cricket is the most popular sport in the city.

Though in Sanskrit Mahisha means buffalo, here Mahisha refers to Mahishasura , a mythological demon who could assume the form of both human and buffalo. According to Hindu mythology , the area was ruled by the demon Mahishasura. [ 5 ] The demon was killed by the Goddess Chamundeshwari , whose temple is situated atop the Chamundi Hills . Mahishūru later became Mahisūru (a name which, even now, the royal family uses) and finally came to be called Maisūru, its present name in the Kannada language . [ 6 ] In December 2005, the Government of Karnataka announced its intention to change the English name of the city to Mysuru . [ 7 ] This has been approved by the Government of India , but as of 2011 [update] the formalities necessary to incorporate the name change were yet to be completed. [ 8 ] Center government have approved this request in October 2014 and Mysore is renamed (along with other 12 cities) to "Mysuru" on November 1, 2014. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] History [ edit ] Further information: Kingdom of Mysore Narasaraja Wodeyar II ruled from 1704 to 1714. The site where Mysore Palace now stands was occupied by a village named Puragere at the beginning of the 16th century. [ 12 ] :281 The Mahishūru Fort was constructed in 1524 by Chamaraja Wodeyar III (1513–1553), [ 12 ] :257 who passed on the dominion of Puragere to his son Chamaraja Wodeyar IV (1572–1576). Since the 16th century, the name of Mahishūru has commonly been used to denote the city. [ 13 ] :31 The Mysore Kingdom , governed by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire . With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, the Mysore Kingdom gradually achieved independence,and by the time of King Narasaraja Wodeyar (1637) it had become a sovereign state. [ 14 ] :228 Seringapatam (modern-day Srirangapatna), near Mysore, was the capital of the kingdom from 1610. [ 12 ] :257 The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar , the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan . The kingdom reached the height of its military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under the de facto rulers Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan . The latter demolished parts of Mysore to remove legacies of the Wodeyar dynasty. [ 12 ] :257 During this time, Mysore kingdom came into conflict with the Marathas , the British and the Nizam of Golconda , leading to the four Anglo-Mysore wars , success in the first two of which was followed by defeat in the third and fourth. After Tipu Sultan's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799, the capital of the kingdom was moved back to Mysore from Seringapatam, [ 14 ] :249 and the kingdom was distributed by the British to their allies of the Fourth Mysore war. The landlocked interior of the previous Mysore Kingdom was turned into a princely state under the suzerainty of the British Crown . The former Wodeyar rulers were reinstated as puppet monarchs , now styled Maharajas . The British administration was assisted locally by Diwan (chief minister) Purnaiah . Purnaiah is credited with improving Mysore's public works. [ 14 ] :249 Mysore lost its status as the administrative centre of the kingdom in 1831, when the British commissioner moved the capital to Bangalore . [ 14 ] :251 It regained that status in 1881 [ 14 ] :254 and remained the capital of the Princely State of Mysore within the British Indian Empire until India became independent in 1947. The Mysore municipality was established in 1888 and the city was divided into eight wards. [ 13 ] :283 In 1897 an outbreak of bubonic plague killed nearly half of the population of the city. [ 15 ] With the establishment of the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB) in 1903, Mysore became one of the first cities in Asia to undertake planned development of the city. [ 16 ] Public demonstrations and meetings were held there during the Quit India movement and other phases of the Indian independence movement . [ 17 ] After Indian independence, Mysore city remained as part of the Mysore State , now known as Karnataka . Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar , then king of Mysore, was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the Rajapramukh (appointed governor) of the state. He died in September 1974 and was cremated in Mysore city. [ 18 ] Over the years, Mysore became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri river water dispute . [ 19 ] Among the events that took place in Mysore and made national headlines were a fire at a television studio that claimed 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the Mysore Zoo .

[ 29 ] Urban growth and expansion is managed by the Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA), which is headed by a commissioner. Its activities include developing new layouts and roads, town planning and land acquisition. One of the major projects undertaken by MUDA is the creation of an Outer Ring Road to ease traffic congestion. [ 30 ] Citizens of Mysore have criticized MUDA for its inability to prevent land mafias and ensure lawful distribution of housing lands among city residents. [ 31 ] The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation is responsible for electric supply to the city. [ 32 ] Drinking water for Mysore is sourced from the Kaveri and Kabini rivers. [ 23 ] :53 The city got its first piped water supply when the Belagola project was commissioned in 1896. [ 33 ] As of 2011, Mysore gets 42.5 million gallons water per day. Mysore sometimes faces water crises, mainly during the summer months (March–June) and in years of low rainfall. [ 34 ] The city has had an underground drainage system since 1904. The entire sewage from the city drains into four valleys: Kesare, Malalavadi, Dalavai and Belavatha.

[ 45 ] Mysore has traditionally been home to industries such as weaving, sandalwood carving, bronze work and the production of lime and salt. [ 46 ] The planned industrial growth of the city and the state was first envisaged at the Mysore economic conference in 1911. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] This led to the establishment of industries such as the Mysore Sandalwood Oil Factory in 1917 and the Sri Krishnarajendra Mills in 1920. [ 48 ] :270, 278 For the industrial development of the city, the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) has established four industrial areas in and around Mysore, in the Belagola, Belawadi, Hebbal and Hootagalli areas.

Culture [ edit ] Main article: Culture of Mysore Mysore painting depicting the goddess Saraswati Referred to as the cultural capital of South Karnataka, Mysore is well known for the festivities that take place during the period of Dasara , the state festival of Karnataka. The Dasara festivities, which are celebrated over a ten-day period, were first introduced by King Raja Wodeyar I in 1610. [ 53 ] On the ninth day of Dasara , called Mahanavami , the royal sword is worshipped and is taken on a procession of decorated elephants, camels and horses. [ 53 ] On the tenth day, called Vijayadashami , the traditional Dasara procession (locally known as Jumboo Savari ) is held on the streets of Mysore which usually falls in the month of September or October.. the Idol of the Goddess Chamundeshwari is placed on a golden mantapa on the back of a decorated elephant and taken on a procession, accompanied by tabla, dance groups, music bands, decorated elephants, horses and camels. [ 53 ] The procession starts from the Mysore Palace and culminates at a place called Bannimantapa , where the banni tree ( Prosopis spicigera ) is worshipped. [ 53 ] The Dasara festivities culminate on the night of Vijayadashami with a torchlight parade, known locally as Panjina Kavayatthu . [ 53 ] Mysore is called the City of Palaces because of several ornate examples in the city. Among the most notable are Amba Vilas , popularly known as Mysore Palace; Jaganmohana Palace , which also serves as an art gallery; Rajendra Vilas , also known as the summer palace; Lalitha Mahal , which has been converted into a hotel; and Jayalakshmi Vilas . [ 54 ] :87–88 The main palace of Mysore was burned down in 1897, and the present-day structure was built on the same site. Amba Vilas palace exhibits an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture on the outside, but a distinctly Hoysala style in the interior. [ 54 ] :82 Even though the Government of Karnataka maintains the Mysore palace, a small portion has been allocated for the erstwhile Royal family to live in. The Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion was constructed by Sri Chamaraja Wodeyar for his daughter Jayalakshammanni. It is now a museum dedicated to folk culture and artifacts of the royal family. [ 55 ] The ex-prince of Mysore Kingdom, who continued to use the title of Prince and traditions of the royal family. The Mysore painting style is an offshoot of the Vijayanagar school of painting, and King Raja Wodeyar (1578–1617 CE) is credited with having been its patron. [ 56 ] :1 The distinctive feature of these paintings is the gesso work, to which gold foil is applied. [ 56 ] :3 Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. [ 57 ] The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread).

[ 63 ] Transport [ edit ] Road [ edit ] Mysore has one of the best city transportation systems in India Mysore is connected by National Highway NH-212 to the state border town of Gundlupet , where the road forks into the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. [ 64 ] :1 State Highway 17 , which connects Mysore to Bangalore, was upgraded to a four-lane highway in 2006, reducing travel time between the two cities. [ 65 ] A project was planned in 1994 to construct a new expressway to connect Bangalore and Mysore. After numerous legal hurdles, it remains unfinished as of 2012 [update] . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] State Highways 33 and 88 which connect Mysore to H D Kote and Madikeri respectively.

Gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the Vontikoppal area of Mysore, using a 50-watt transmitter. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] The station was taken over by the princely state of Mysore in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955. In 1957, Akashvani was chosen as the official name of All India Radio (AIR), the radio broadcaster of the Government of India. The AIR station at Mysore broadcasts an FM radio channel at 100.6 MHz , [ 78 ] and Gyan Vani broadcasts on 105.2. [ 79 ] BIG FM and Red FM are the two private FM channels operating in the city. [ 80 ] Mysore started receiving television broadcasts in the early 1980s, when Doordarshan ( public service broadcaster of the Indian government) started broadcasting its national channel all over India. This was the only channel available to Mysoreans until Star TV started satellite channels in 1991. Direct-to-home channels are now available in Mysore. [ 81 ] Sports [ edit ] The Wodeyar kings of Mysore were patrons of games and sports. King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III had a passion for indoor games. He invented new board games and popularised the ganjifa card game. [ 82 ] Malla-yuddha (traditional wrestling) has a history in Mysore dating back to the 16th century. [ 83 ] The wrestling competition held in Mysore during the Dasara celebrations attracts wrestlers from all over India. An annual sports meeting is organised there during the Dasara season too. [ 84 ] In 1997 Mysore and Bangalore co-hosted the city's biggest sports event ever, the National Games of India .
