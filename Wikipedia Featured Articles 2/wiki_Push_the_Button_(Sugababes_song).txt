Development of "Push the Button" began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). [ 1 ] American producer and songwriter Dallas Austin collaborated with the group during the album's initial stages of development. [ 2 ] He visited London to work with them, [ 3 ] although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in Atlanta , Georgia. [ 1 ] Austin wrote five tracks for the album, including "Push the Button", which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes. [ 3 ] According to group member Heidi Range , the song was "the very last thing" completed for the album. [ 4 ] "Push the Button" was conceptualised after group member Keisha Buchanan developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin. [ 1 ] Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian that she made advances towards the man, but he was unaware of her intentions: "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say." [ 1 ] Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to "push that button" or she would eventually move on. [ 1 ] Mutya Buena , another member of the Sugababes, clarified Buchanan's encounter with the artist to Hot Press magazine's Jackie Hayden, saying: "We all knew there was something going on between them at the time, but we try to give each other space." [ 5 ] She described "Push the Button" as a song "with meaning and real life references", and characterised it as having a "street vibe". [ 6 ] Austin produced the song, which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings, London. [ 7 ] "Push the Button" was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, in collaboration with Richard Edgeler. [ 7 ] Rick Shepphard engineered the song.
