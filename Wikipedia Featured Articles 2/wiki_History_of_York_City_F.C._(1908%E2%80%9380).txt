History of York City F.C. (1908–80)
For an account of the club's history since 1980, see History of York City F.C. (1980–present) . The York City squad before a match in 1922 York City Football Club is a professional association football club based in York , North Yorkshire , England. The history of York City F.C. from 1908 to 1980 covers the period from the club's original foundation, through their reformation and progress in the Football League , to the end of the 1979–80 season . Originally founded in 1908, York City played several seasons in the Northern League and Midland League before going into liquidation during the First World War. The club was reformed in 1922 and was elected to play in the Midland League for 1922–23. After seven seasons in the Midland League, they were elected to play in the Football League for 1929–30 , and were placed in the Third Division North . During the Second World War, York played in regional competitions, before the Football League restored its usual competitions in 1946–47 . After fourteen seasons in the Football League, the club was required to apply for re-election for the first time because they finished 1949–50 at the bottom of the Third Division North. York had their best FA Cup season in 1954–55 , when they reached the semi-final; they were defeated by First Division club Newcastle United in a replay . York played in the Third Division North until 1958–59 , when a league reorganisation placed them in the Fourth Division . The same season, they finished third and won their first-ever promotion , but were relegated after one season . York won another promotion in 1964–65 , but were again relegated after one season . The club won a third promotion to the now-unified Third Division in 1970–71 , remaining there for the next two seasons on goal average . They were promoted into the Second Division for the first and only time in 1973–74 . By mid-October 1974, York were in fifth place—their highest league placing—before finishing 1974–75 in fifteenth place. They faced two successive relegations in 1976 and 1977, and a twenty-second place finish in the 1977–78 Fourth Division forced the club to apply for re-election.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] York City Football Club was founded as an amateur club, joining the Northern League for the 1908–09 season and acquiring a ground in Holgate Road at the end of Lindley Street and Murray Street. [ 1 ] [ 3 ] York won their first match 2–1 at home to South Bank , but finished the season eleventh out of twelve teams in the Northern League. [ 4 ] During this season the club entered the FA Amateur Cup ; after beating Withernsea and St Paul's the team were knocked out by Scarborough in a replay . [ 4 ] York finished in last place in 1909–10 , before joining the Yorkshire Combination to reduce travelling. [ 4 ] York competed in this division for two seasons; after finishing eighth in a ten-team league in 1910–11 they ranked in the same position in an expanded league of fourteen teams the following season. [ 3 ] J. E. Wright took over as secretary in 1911, and advocated the formation of a limited company to run a professional club, believing amateur football would not succeed in a rugby league stronghold. [ 4 ] The club turned professional in 1912, and acquired a rough plot of land known as Field View. [ 4 ] York were admitted into the Midland League in June 1912, [ 5 ] and the new ground was opened with a 2–1 win over Rotherham Town , which was played before 5,000 spectators. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] They played in the Midland League for three seasons, achieving a highest finish of tenth of twenty teams in 1912–13 before ranking twelfth in an eighteen-team league the following season. [ 8 ] York were invited to a meeting to discuss the formation of a Third Division of the Football League , but with the outbreak of the First World War the meeting did not take place. [ 6 ] Because of hostilities the Midland League was suspended after 1914–15, in which York ranked sixteenth of twenty teams. [ 8 ] The club went into liquidation through the bankruptcy court in August 1917 after a creditor pressed for payment for the ground's stand. [ 6 ] [ 9 ] York's ground was taken over by the York Corporation, who leased it to allotment-holders. [ 10 ] 1922–39: Refoundation and establishment in Football League [ edit ] York played at Fulfordgate after the club's foundation in 1922. As local football continued to expand after the war, and with the success of the newly formed Yorkshire League , demand for another senior team in York arose. [ 11 ] At a meeting held at the Co-operative Hall in York on 6 May 1922, the decision was made to form the York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited, with W. H. Shaw as chairman. [ 11 ] Despite having neither a ground nor players, an application was made for election into the Football League; this was unsuccessful but the club was admitted into the Midland League on 10 June 1922. [ 12 ] York's first match was away to Notts County reserves on 6 September 1922, and despite a good performance the team lost 4–2. [ 13 ] York had to play their first two home matches at Mille Crux, the ground of Messrs Rowntree & Company Limited , because their Fulfordgate ground was not ready. [ 13 ] Their first match at Fulfordgate came on 20 September 1922, with a 4–1 victory against Mansfield Town . [ 14 ] York finished 1922–23 in nineteenth place; [ 8 ] they had been placed mid-table in early-March 1923 but failed to win any of their remaining fourteen fixtures. [ 13 ] In the same year York reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup but lost 4–2 to Middlesbrough reserves at Ayresome Park on 10 March 1923. [ 15 ] The club's first season proved disappointing financially, with a loss of £718 reported, and as a consequence Shaw relinquished the chairmanship to Arthur Brown. [ 16 ] York entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1923–24 and reached the first qualifying round, losing 3–1 to Mexborough Town in a second replay. [ 17 ] They again ranked nineteenth in the table with an almost identical record to the previous season's. [ 8 ] For 1924–25 the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve teams from the competition. [ 18 ] York finished sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. [ 18 ] The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity of the directors. [ 19 ] John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. [ 20 ] The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925–26 and York finished in sixteenth place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. [ 19 ] York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926–27, when they finished in sixth place and scored ninety-six goals in thirty-eight league matches. [ 8 ] They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds for the first time this season, being beaten 2–1 by Second Division side Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. [ 21 ] In 1927 the club made its first serious attempt for election into the Football League, [ 21 ] but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. [ 22 ] Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. [ 20 ] After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927–28, [ 8 ] York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager . [ 23 ] York finished ninth in 1928–29, [ 8 ] and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with forty-nine goals. [ 24 ] This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election into the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North . [ 25 ] York moved to Bootham Crescent in 1932. York's first match in the Football League was against Wigan Borough at Springfield Park on 31 August 1929 and finished with a 2–0 victory for the visitors. [ 26 ] Reg Stockill , the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match at the age of 15 years and 281 days. [ 27 ] The 1929–30 season brought two meetings with First Division club Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth place finish in York's debut Football League season. [ 28 ] Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and George Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. [ 29 ] Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank twelfth in the league, [ 30 ] and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. [ 31 ] Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931–32 , York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. [ 28 ] This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of £1,539 over the season. [ 32 ] In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent , [ 33 ] which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's centre of support and the railway station . [ 34 ] The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2–2 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground was Tom Mitchell . [ 35 ] York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932–33 , finishing in twentieth place. [ 28 ] The club only avoided having to seek re-election after winning the last match of the season. [ 36 ] Collier was re-appointed manager in May 1933, [ 37 ] and York enjoyed a better season in 1933–34 , finishing twelfth in the Third Division North. [ 38 ] The club finished in fifteenth place in 1934–35 , [ 39 ] and Bootham Crescent staged its first match against First Division opposition when Derby County defeated York 1–0 in the FA Cup third round. [ 40 ] In 1935–36 York ranked in sixteenth place, [ 41 ] and by the end of the season the club's debt was £7,048. [ 42 ] The annual report stated that "increased support must be forthcoming if the club was to retain its Football League status". [ 42 ] The team reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time in 1936–37 , being eliminated by Second Division club Swansea Town in a replay. [ 28 ] Collier retired from football in March 1937 to go into business with his brother, [ 43 ] and was replaced by Tom Mitchell. [ 44 ] The team finished an inconsistent season in twelfth place. [ 42 ] The 1937–38 season saw York placed "firmly on the football map", as the team eliminated First Division West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough from the FA Cup, before meeting Huddersfield Town in the sixth round. [ 45 ] This match saw York draw 0–0 at home before a crowd of 28,123, the club's record highest attendance. [ 46 ] York lost the replay 2–1 at Leeds Road , a match that attracted 58,066 spectators. [ 47 ] By the end of that season's FA Cup run York were on the fringe of the promotion race but faltered in the closing weeks [ 48 ] and finished in eleventh place. [ 49 ] The club avoided having to apply for re-election with a win in the penultimate match of 1938–39 , [ 50 ] ranking twentieth in the table. [ 51 ] W. H. Sessions was appointed chairman to succeed Brown in 1939. [ 20 ] 1939–59: Wartime football, FA Cup run and first promotion [ edit ] York's league positions since 1929–30 At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 the Football League was suspended indefinitely, [ 52 ] leaving the club with no revenue. [ 53 ] The Football League organised regional competitions [ 54 ] after the government gave the Football Association permission for football to proceed on a wartime footing. [ 55 ] York decided to carry on playing [ 56 ] and were placed in the North East League, where they ranked eighth in their section of eleven clubs. [ 57 ] In the final weeks of 1939–40, York competed in the Football League War Cup . [ 58 ] The club was placed in the Football League North for 1940–41, and finished thirty-second in the thirty-six-club league. [ 57 ] They beat Sheffield Wednesday 7–0 in the War Cup, before being eliminated by Newcastle United in the second round. [ 59 ] After completing eighteen fixtures in the 1941–42 Football League North, York competed in the league-organised qualifying stage of the War Cup. [ 60 ] They were eliminated after ranking thirty-third of fifty-four clubs, failing to qualify for the knock-out stages by one place. [ 60 ] York played in the Combined Counties Cup in the season's closing weeks, and beat Halifax Town 5–4 over two legs in the final. [ 61 ] After ranking seventeenth of forty-eight clubs in the Football League North in 1942–43, [ 62 ] York progressed through the War Cup qualifying stages, reaching the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time. [ 63 ] They were beaten 4–1 over two legs by Sheffield Wednesday. [ 63 ] In the 1943–44 Football League North the team finished thirty-first of fifty clubs, [ 64 ] and after qualifying for the War Cup knock-out stages were eliminated 7–2 over two legs by Bradford Park Avenue in the second round. [ 65 ] York experienced selection problems in 1944–45 with many players leaving for war service; [ 66 ] after ranking forty-second of fifty-four clubs in the Football League North, [ 67 ] they then failed to qualify for the War Cup knock-out stages. [ 68 ] They extended their programme by competing in the Tyne, Wear and Tees Cup. [ 66 ] Although hostilities had finished by the start of 1945–46, there was insufficient time for the Football League to restore its usual competitions. [ 66 ] York finished mid-table in the Third Division North (East) in the first half of the season, before reaching the second round of the Third Division North (East) Cup after qualifying through the group stages. [ 69 ] The FA Cup resumed this season, and for the first and only time ties were played on a two-legged basis. [ 66 ] York reached the fourth round, at which point they were beaten 11–1 on aggregate by Sheffield Wednesday. [ 70 ] York made a profit in five of the seven seasons played during the war. [ 70 ] Peacetime football resumed in 1946–47 , with the same fixture list as the abandoned 1939–40 season. [ 71 ] York endured a mid-season run of ten defeats from eleven matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches [ 72 ] saw them finish in fifteenth place in the Third Division North. [ 73 ] They were top of the table by mid-September 1947, before a run of two wins from thirteen matches saw them drop to eighteenth place. [ 74 ] York finished 1947–48 in thirteenth place, [ 75 ] and the club recorded a net profit of £4,914; a balance surplus of £1,843 was carried forward. [ 76 ] In September 1948 York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for £4,075. [ 77 ] They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948–49 at the peak of the post-war attendance boom. [ 78 ] The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures [ 79 ] to finish 1948–49 in fourteenth place. [ 80 ] Mitchell resigned as manager in February 1950 [ 81 ] and was replaced in April with Dick Duckworth , a former York player. [ 82 ] York were forced to apply for re-election to retain their place in the Football League for the first time, [ 83 ] after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949–50 . [ 84 ] They did not have to enter the ballot because the Football League was to be extended to ninety-two clubs for 1950–51 . [ 83 ] Despite York's senior team's troubles, the reserve team scored over one hundred goals to finish sixth in the Midland League, and won the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time after beating Middlesbrough 3–0 at Ayresome Park in the final. [ 83 ] York's fortunes improved in 1950–51; they ranked seventeenth in the league [ 85 ] and reached the FA Cup third round for the first time since 1946, when they were beaten 2–0 by First Division Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park . [ 28 ] York's best post-war season to date came in 1951–52 , as they finished in tenth place and set a home record of sixteen wins, four draws and three defeats. [ 86 ] York chased promotion in 1952–53 , and by late-January 1953 they were third in the table. [ 87 ] They finished in fourth place with fifty-three points; both new club records in the Football League. [ 28 ] During this season Duckworth was reluctantly released from his contract to take charge at Stockport County in October 1952. [ 88 ] His successor, the former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer , died in February 1953. [ 89 ] Sheffield United's assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, [ 90 ] and by late-December York were bottom of the table. [ 91 ] A win in the last match of 1953–54 meant they finished in twenty-second place, and avoided having to apply for re-election. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Sessions resigned as chairman in November 1953 and was succeeded by Hugh Kitchin. [ 20 ] York's FA Cup semi-final replay with Newcastle United was played at Roker Park . After a dispute with the directors over team selection, McCormick resigned in September 1954, after which team affairs were handled by trainer Tom Lockie and secretary George Sherrington. [ 94 ] With an emphasis on close-passing attacking football, [ 94 ] the team embarked on a ten-match unbeaten sequence. [ 95 ] In the 1954–55 FA Cup , York became the first third-tier club to participate in an FA Cup semi-final replay. [ 96 ] York beat Scarborough, Dorchester Town , Blackpool (winners of the competition eighteen months earlier), Bishop Auckland , Tottenham Hotspur and Notts County in the previous rounds before playing Newcastle United in the semi-final. [ 97 ] After drawing 1–1 at Hillsborough , York were defeated 2–0 in the replay at Roker Park , which ended an FA Cup campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals. [ 98 ] The team were billed "The Happy Wanderers" after a popular song ; [ 99 ] Henry Rose of the Daily Express said, "There are no weak spots in this First Division side masquerading in Third Division shirts". [ 100 ] By the end of the cup run, York were on the fringes of the Third Division North promotion race, but injuries and a congested fixture list led to them finishing fourth in 1954–55 . [ 101 ] Bottom was the divisional top scorer that season, with thirty-one goals. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] York were optimistic for 1955–56 , [ 104 ] and they were top of the table after ten matches. [ 105 ] A run of nine consecutive matches without a win saw York drop out of promotion contention, [ 105 ] and they finished eleventh. [ 106 ] That season's FA Cup run included a 2–1 win over a Swansea Town side featuring eight Wales internationals at Vetch Field in the third round. [ 107 ] They then played First Division Sunderland , billed as the " Bank of England club " because of their high expenditure on transfers , York were beaten 2–1 at Roker Park in a replay. [ 104 ] During this season York filled the managerial position that had been vacant for the last eighteen months; Arsenal player Don Roper rejected the job before Sam Bartram was appointed in March 1956. [ 108 ] Bartram, a former Charlton Athletic player, was a popular choice, having been a favourite with the fans while playing for the club during the war. [ 104 ] York invested heavily in transfers for 1956–57 , spending £12,000 on fees—a sizeable amount at that time. [ 104 ] The aim was promotion into the Second Division, but the team failed to make the intended impact and finished in seventh place. [ 109 ] The 1957–58 season was the last of regionalised football; the top twelve clubs in the North and South sections would form the new Third Division, and the bottom clubs would become founder members of the Fourth Division . [ 110 ] York went into the Easter period third from bottom, but after seven wins and three draws in their last ten matches they missed out on a top-twelve position on goal average . [ 111 ] York led the Fourth Division until early-November 1958, [ 112 ] and despite faltering mid-term continued strongly to finish third in 1958–59 and gain promotion for the first time. [ 113 ] They only missed out on the runner-up spot to Coventry City on goal average. [ 114 ] 1959–80: Promotions, relegations and spell in Second Division [ edit ] Club crest during the 1960s and 1970s By late-February 1960, York were placed twelfth in the Third Division. [ 115 ] After one season , in which the team won only two of their last fourteen matches, [ 115 ] they were relegated from the Third Division in twenty-first place. [ 116 ] Bartram was released from his contact in July 1960 and was replaced by Lockie. [ 117 ] His team started 1960–61 well, and were fourth by mid-November 1960. [ 118 ] York endured five successive defeats before a winning run in the New Year revived their promotion hopes. [ 119 ] They finished the season in fifth place, [ 120 ] having won only one of their last seven matches. [ 118 ] Throughout 1961–62 York were in or around the top four places, but missed out on promotion after losing 1–0 to Aldershot in the last match, [ 121 ] finishing in sixth place. [ 122 ] That season, York enjoyed their best run in the newly instituted League Cup . [ 28 ] In this competition they beat First Division club Leicester City , but were eliminated after a 2–1 defeat to divisional rivals Rochdale at Spotland Stadium in the fifth round. [ 123 ] York made a poor start to 1962–63 and were second from bottom by late-December 1962, [ 124 ] but their form improved from March 1963 and they finished the season fourteenth. [ 125 ] Club historian David Batters described the 1963–64 season as "one of the worst in the club's history". [ 125 ] York spent most of the season in the bottom four [ 126 ] before finishing twenty-second, [ 127 ] having to apply for re-election for the second time. [ 125 ] This application was successful, as the club polled the maximum forty-eight votes. [ 128 ] During this season a football betting scandal exposed by the newspaper Sunday People accused York player Jack Fountain of fixing match results . [ 125 ] His contract was terminated and he was found guilty of fixing two matches York lost. [ 125 ] York produced some of their best football in a decade in 1964–65 , winning twenty league matches at home—a club record [ 128 ] —and ending the season in third place to gain promotion, one point behind champions Brighton & Hove Albion . [ 129 ] The following season they were in the bottom four by late-December 1965. [ 130 ] They finished the season in bottom place and were relegated back into the Fourth Division, [ 131 ] having conceded a club-record 106 goals. [ 28 ] After the season ended York released Norman Wilkinson , who had scored a record 143 goals for the club. [ 132 ] York struggled throughout 1966–67 and finished twenty-second after a club-record eight successive defeats. [ 133 ] The club was forced into its third re-election bid, which was successful with forty-five votes. [ 133 ] Kitchin resigned the chairmanship in June 1967 and was succeeded by Derrick Blundy, who held the position for sixteen months, after which Eric Magson took over. [ 133 ] York started 1967–68 winning none of their first thirteen matches. [ 134 ] Their first win came in late-October 1967, [ 134 ] by which time Lockie had become the first manager to be sacked by the club. [ 135 ] Former Sheffield United player Joe Shaw took charge in November 1967, [ 136 ] and York rose from bottom place to fourteenth by late-March 1968. [ 134 ] However, they won none of their last eight matches [ 134 ] and finished twenty-first. [ 137 ] Another application for re-election was made, which was successful with forty-six votes. [ 135 ] Shaw resigned for personal reasons a week into 1968–69 , and former Huddersfield Town manager Tom Johnston succeeded him in October 1968. [ 135 ] Poor away form led to York finishing twenty-first, and the club's application for re-election was successful with forty-five votes. [ 138 ] The team reached the FA Cup third round, and were beaten 2–0 at home by First Division Stoke City . [ 139 ] York were fourth in the table twelve matches into 1969–70 . [ 140 ] Their promotion challenge faded [ 138 ] and they finished the season thirteenth. [ 141 ] York reached the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 1958, and played two Second Division teams; after beating Cardiff City 3–1 at St Andrew's in a second replay, they lost 4–1 to Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. [ 28 ] Barry Jackson , who made a club-record 539 appearances for York, was released at the end of the season. [ 138 ] York started 1970–71 strongly, and after faltering mid-season they went unbeaten in sixteen consecutive matches to enter the top four. [ 142 ] Despite losing three of their last four fixtures, [ 142 ] York remained in fourth place to earn a third promotion. [ 143 ] They also reached the FA Cup fourth round for the second successive season; after drawing 3–3 at home to First Division Southampton they were beaten 3–2 in the replay at the Dell . [ 28 ] York started 1971–72 with three wins from eight matches, but after failing to win in eleven consecutive matches they dropped into the bottom four. [ 144 ] They finished nineteenth on goal average and avoided relegation. [ 145 ] In the third round of the League Cup York played First Division club Sheffield United, losing 3–1 at Bramall Lane . [ 144 ] York failed to win any of their first eleven matches in 1972–73 , but results improved and they were tenth in the table by early-March 1973. [ 146 ] Another downturn in form followed before York beat Rotherham United in the last match of the season [ 146 ] to finish eighteenth, avoiding relegation from the Third Division on goal average for the second successive year. [ 147 ] York endured successive relegations from the Second Division to the Fourth Division under Wilf McGuinness . From mid-November 1973 York remained within the top three in 1973–74 [ 148 ] [ 149 ] and won promotion into the Second Division for the first time, in the season "three up, three down" was introduced in the top three divisions. [ 150 ] Promotion was secured after a 1–1 home draw against Oldham Athletic on 27 April 1974. [ 150 ] This season, York held First Division Manchester City to a 0–0 home draw in the League Cup fourth round, before being beaten 4–1 in the replay at Maine Road . [ 148 ] In January 1974 Bob Strachan became chairman and served on the FA Council , the first York official to do so. [ 150 ] The team drew 1–1 at home with Aston Villa in their opening Second Division match on 17 August 1974, with Barry Lyons the York goalscorer. [ 151 ] After starting 1974–75 well, York were fifth in the table by mid-October 1974 [ 152 ] —the club's highest-ever placing in the Football League. [ 153 ] York finished in fifteenth place, [ 154 ] and the season's highlights included doubles over Norwich City —who won promotion—and Fulham —who were FA Cup finalists that season. [ 153 ] York were exempt from the FA Cup until the third round, where they drew 1–1 with First Division team Arsenal at Highbury ; in the replay, Arsenal won 3–1 after extra time at York. [ 152 ] Johnston left to take over at Huddersfield Town in January 1975, [ 155 ] and was succeeded in February by former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness . [ 156 ] York started 1975–76 with two wins from eight fixtures, but a run of ten defeats from eleven matches saw them drop into the bottom two. [ 157 ] Seven successive defeats in the New Year saw York drop to bottom place, although results improved in the season's closing weeks. [ 157 ] They were relegated into the Third Division in twenty-first place, [ 158 ] after a 2–2 home draw with Chelsea on 24 April 1976. [ 157 ] They lost their League Cup second round match 1–0 at home to First Division Liverpool . [ 157 ] York started 1976–77 poorly, and they were in the bottom two of the Third Division for most of the first half of the season. [ 159 ] The mid-season signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an improvement in results, [ 160 ] but after winning only one of their last fifteen matches [ 159 ] they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. [ 161 ] The 1977–78 season also started poorly; York lost seven of their opening twelve matches, leaving them seventeenth in the table. [ 162 ] McGuinness was sacked in October 1977 [ 163 ] and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright , a former Charlton Athletic player. [ 164 ] York remained in the lower reaches of the table [ 162 ] and finished the season in twenty-second place, [ 165 ] forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. [ 160 ] This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. [ 160 ] This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in a boardroom shuffle in April 1978. [ 160 ] Results improved in 1978–79 ; York finished tenth in the Fourth Division [ 166 ] and reached the FA Cup fourth round. [ 167 ] They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest , and were beaten 3–1 at the City Ground . [ 168 ] In 1979–80 York were consistently in the lower reaches of the table, [ 169 ] before finishing seventeenth. [ 170 ] With the club eighteenth in the table by mid-March 1980 Wright was sacked. [ 169 ] [ 171 ] Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager , before being appointed permanently in May 1980. [ 172 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b Batters, David (2008).
