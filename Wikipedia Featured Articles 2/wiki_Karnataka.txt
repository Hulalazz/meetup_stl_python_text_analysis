It was formed on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act . Originally known as the State of Mysore , it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. [ 8 ] The capital and largest city is Bangalore (Bengaluru). Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea and the Laccadive Sea to the west, Goa to the north west, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the North east, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the south east, and Kerala to the south west. The state covers an area of 191,976 square kilometres (74,122 sq mi), or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. It is the seventh largest Indian state by area . With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth largest state by population , comprising 30 districts . Kannada is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima , Ghataprabha , Vedavathi , Malaprabha , and Tungabhadra , in the north, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati , Shimsha , Arkavati , Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini , in the south. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward into the Bay of Bengal . Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu , meaning "elevated land". Karu nadu may also be read as karu , meaning "black", and nadu , meaning "region", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic , sometimes Karnatak , to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna. [ 9 ] With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic , Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India . The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions.

[ 10 ] Evidence of neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation ca. 3300 BCE. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Nanda Empire before coming under the Mauryan empire of Emperor Ashoka . Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas , marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty , founded by Mayurasharma , had its capital at Banavasi ; [ 13 ] [ 14 ] the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Hoysala Empire sculptural articulation in Belur . Shilabalika sculpture at the Chennakeshva Temple in Belur These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] the Rashtrakuta Empire of Manyakheta [ 21 ] [ 22 ] and the Western Chalukya Empire , [ 23 ] [ 24 ] which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of 12th century. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Parts of modern-day Southern Karnataka (Gangavadi) were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of 11th century. [ 27 ] The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule. [ 27 ] Statue of Ugranarasimha at Hampi (a World Heritage Site ), located within the ruins of Vijayanagara , the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire . At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres , and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara ), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota . [ 34 ] The Bijapur Sultanate , which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style. [ 37 ] During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette , Goa , [ 38 ] while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to South Canara , especially from Bardes , Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese . [ 39 ] An inveterate enemy of the British , Tipu Sultan of the Mysore Kingdom resisted the growth of the British Raj until his death in 1799 In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Maratha Empire , the British , and other powers. [ 40 ] In the south, the Mysore Kingdom , a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent. [ 41 ] With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II , Haidar Ali , the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tippu Sultan . [ 42 ] To contain European expansion in South India, Haidar Ali and later Tippu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars , the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj in 1799. [ 43 ] The Kingdom of Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars and Mysore remained a princely state under the British Raj. As the " doctrine of lapse " gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, Kittur Chennamma , Sangolli Rayanna and others spearheaded rebellions in Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at Supa , Bagalkot , Shorapur , Nargund and Dandeli . These rebellions — which coincided with the Indian Rebellion of 1857 - were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave, the Halagali Bedas, Raja Venkatappa Nayaka and others. By the late 19th century, the independence movement had gained momentum; Karnad Sadashiva Rao, Aluru Venkata Raya , S. Nijalingappa , Kengal Hanumanthaiah , Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century. [ 44 ] Historical image showing the then-Chief Minister Dr. Devaraja Urs announcing the declaration of Karnataka name to the Mysore state. After India's independence, the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar , allowed his kingdom's accession to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement , Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamed Karnataka, seventeen years later, in 1973. [ 45 ] In the early 1900s through the post-independence era, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya born in Muddenahalli , Chikballapur District played an important role in the development of Karnataka's strong manufacturing and industrial base. Geography [ edit ] Main articles: Geography of Karnataka and Rainfall in Karnataka Jog Falls are the highest plunge waterfalls in India, formed by Sharavathi River . The state has three principal geographical zones: The coastal region of Karavali The hilly Malenadu region comprising the Western Ghats The Bayaluseeme region comprising the plains of the Deccan plateau The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second-largest arid region in India. [ 46 ] The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in Chickmagalur district which has an altitude of 1,929 metres (6,329 ft). Some of the important rivers in Karnataka are Kaveri , Tungabhadra , Krishna , Malaprabha and the Sharavathi . Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations [ 47 ] — the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses , the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% of the state is composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols , Inceptisols , Mollisols , Spodosols , Alfisols , Ultisols , Oxisols , Aridisols , Vertisols , Andisols and Histosols . [ 47 ] Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic , black , alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils. Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. Meteorologically , Karnataka is divided into three zones — coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about 3,638.5 mm (143 in) per annum, far in excess of the state average of 1,139 mm (45 in). Agumbe in the Shivamogga district receives the second highest annual rainfall in India. [ 48 ] The highest recorded temperature was 45.6 °C (114 °F ) at Raichur and the lowest recorded temperature was 2.8 °C (37 °F) at Bidar . About 38,724 km 2 (14,951 sq mi) of Karnataka (i.e. 20% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests. The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests. The percentage of forested area is slightly less than the all-India average of about 23%, and significantly less than the 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy. [ 49 ] Sub-divisions [ edit ] Districts of Karnataka Main article: Districts of Karnataka There are 30 districts in Karnataka: Bagalkote Bengaluru Rural Bengaluru Urban Belagavi Ballari Bidar Vijayapura Chamarajanagar Chikkaballapur [ 50 ] Chikkamagaluru Chitradurga Dakshina Kannada Davanagere Dharwad Gadag Gulbarga Hassan Haveri Kodagu Kolar Koppal Mandya Mysuru Raichur Ramanagara [ 50 ] Shivamogga Tumkur Udupi Uttara Kannada Yadgir Each district is governed by a district commissioner or district magistrate. The districts are further divided into sub-divisions, which are governed by sub-divisional magistrates; sub-divisions comprise blocks containing panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities. At the 2011 census, Karnataka's ten largest cities, sorted in order of decreasing population, were Bengaluru , Hubballi - Dharwad , Mysuru , Gulbarga , Mangaluru , Belagavi , Davangere , Ballary , Vijayapur and Shivamogga . Bengaluru Urban , Belagavi and Mysore were the most populous districts, each of them having a population of more than three million. Bangalore Rural and Kodagu districts had a population of less than one million.

Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited is an oil refinery located in Mangalore. Contribution to economy by sector Since the 1980s, Karnataka has emerged as the pan-Indian leader in the field of IT ( information technology ). In 2007, there were nearly 2,000 firms operating in Karnataka. Many of them, including two of India's biggest software firms, Infosys and Wipro , are also headquartered in the state. [ 74 ] Exports from these firms exceeded ₹ 50,000 crores ($12.5 billion) in 2006-07, accounting for nearly 38% of all IT exports from India. [ 74 ] The Nandi Hills area in the outskirts of Devanahalli is the site of the upcoming $22 billion, 50 square kilometer BIAL IT Investment Region , one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of Karnataka.

[ 84 ] Major airlines such as Kingfisher Airlines and Kingfisher Red were based in Bangalore. Karnataka has a railway network with a total length of approximately 3,089 kilometres (1,919 mi). Until the creation of the South Western Zone headquartered at Hubli in 2003, the railway network in the state was in the Southern and Western railway zones. Several parts of the state now come under the South Western Zone, with the remainder under the Southern Railways. Coastal Karnataka is covered under the Konkan railway network which was considered India's biggest railway project of the century. [ 85 ] Bangalore and Hubli are extensively connected with inter-state destinations while other important cities and towns in the state are not so well-connected. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Karnataka has 11 ports , including the New Mangalore Port , a major port and ten minor ports, of which three were operational in 2012.

[ 91 ] Karnataka also has a special place in the world of Indian classical music, with both Karnataka [ 92 ] ( Carnatic ) and Hindustani styles finding place in the state, and Karnataka has produced a number of stalwarts in both styles . The Haridasa movement of the sixteenth century contributed significantly to the development of Karnataka (Carnatic) music as a performing art form. Purandara Dasa , one of the most revered Haridasas , is known as the Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ('Father of Karnataka a.k.a. Carnatic music'). [ 93 ] Celebrated Hindustani musicians like Gangubai Hangal , Mallikarjun Mansur , Bhimsen Joshi , Basavaraja Rajaguru , Sawai Gandharva and several others hail from Karnataka, and some of them have been recipients of the Kalidas Samman , Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awards.

Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavāda (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy — one of the three most influential Vedānta philosophies. Madhva was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvācārya is believed to be the third incarnation of Vāyu (Mukhyaprāṇa), after Hanumān and Bhīma. The Haridasa (Kannada: ಹರಿದಾಸ) devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.[1] This movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally "servants of Lord Hari") and took shape in the 13th century - 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as Dasa Sahitya literature of the servants of the Lord. Purandaradasa is widely recognised as the "Pithamaha" of Carnatic Music for his immense contribution. Ramanujacharya , the leading expounder of Viśiṣṭādvaita , spent many years in Melkote . He came to Karnataka in 1098 AD and lived here until 1122 AD. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana Temple and a well-organised Matha were built. He was patronized by the Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana. [ 96 ] World's tallest Basava statue (108 feet), Basavakalyana, Karnataka, India. In the twelfth century, Lingayatism emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were Basava , Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu , who established the Anubhava Mantapa which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Ligayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of 'Vachana Sahitya' which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear Ishtalinga i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. Basava shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaayaka Tatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the Lingayat faith which today counts millions among its followers. [ 97 ] The Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Islam , which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. [ 98 ] Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545. [ 99 ] Buddhism was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as Gulbarga and Banavasi . A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in Gulbarga district in 1986 has proven that the Krishna River basin was once home to both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism. There are Tibetan refugee camps in Karnataka. Mysore Dasara is celebrated as the Nada habba (state festival) and this is marked by major festivities at Mysore. [ 100 ] Ugadi (Kannada New Year), Makara Sankranti (the harvest festival), Ganesh Chaturthi , Nagapanchami , Basava Jayanthi , Deepavali, and Ramzan are the other major festivals of Karnataka. Language [ edit ] Main articles: Kannada language , Tulu language , Kodava language , Konkani language , Kannada literature and Beary bashe Halmidi inscription (450 CE) is the earliest attested inscription in Kannada language ( right-click to enlarge ). The Kannada language serves as the official language of the state of Karnataka, as the native language of approximately 65% of its population and as one of the classical languages of India . [ 101 ] [ 102 ] Kannada played a crucial role in the creation of Karnataka: linguistic demographics played a major role in defining the new state in 1956. Tulu , Kodava and Konkani are other minor native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain dialects such as Sankethi , Dharwad Kannada, Mangaluru Kannada or Malnad Kannada, and Bengaluru Kannada. Kannada features a rich and ancient body of literature including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as Jainism (such as Puranas ), Veerashaivism (such as Vachanas ), Vaishnavism (such as Haridasa Sahitya ) and modern literature . Evidence from edicts during the time of Ashoka the Great (reigned 274–232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the Kannada script and its literature. The Halmidi inscription , the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga , has been dated to 850 CE. References made in the Kavirajamarga , however, prove that Kannada literature flourished in the native composition meters such as Chattana , Beddande and Melvadu during earlier centuries. The classic refers to several earlier greats ( purvacharyar ) of Kannada poetry and prose. [ 103 ] Kuvempu , the renowned Kannada poet and writer who wrote Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate , the state anthem of Karnataka [ 104 ] was the first recipient of the " Karnataka Ratna " award, the highest civilian award bestowed by the Government of Karnataka . Contemporary Kannada literature has received considerable acknowledgement in the arena of Indian literature, with eight Kannada writers winning India's highest literary honour, the Jnanpith award . Tulu is spoken mainly in the coastal districts of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada . Tulu Mahabharato , written by Arunabja in the Tigalari script, is the oldest surviving Tulu text. [ 105 ] Tigalari script was used by Brahmins to write Sanskrit language. The use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in Tigalari script contributed to the marginalization of Tigalari script. The Kodavas who mainly reside in the Kodagu district , speak Kodava Takk. Two regional variations of the language exist, the northern Mendale Takka and the southern Kiggaati Takka . [ 106 ] Konkani is mostly spoken in the Uttara Kannada district and in some parts of the Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. Both Kodava Takk and Konkani use the Kannada script for writing. English is the medium of education in many schools and widely used for business communication in most private companies. All of the state's languages are patronised and promoted by governmental and quasi-governmental bodies. The Kannada Sahitya Parishat and the Kannada Sahitya Akademi are responsible for the promotion of Kannada while the Karnataka Konkani Sahitya Akademi , [ 107 ] The Tulu Sahitya Akademi and the Kodava Sahitya Akademi promote their respective languages.
