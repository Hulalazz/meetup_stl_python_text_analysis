Before Everything Tastes Better with Bacon she wrote four books: The New Complete Coffee Book , The New Tea Book , Christmastime Treats and Weekends with the Kids . [ 3 ] Her editor at Chronicle Books suggested bacon as a cookbook subject. Bacon's popularity and usage was increasing, but Perry believed that a paucity of recipes would make writing the book difficult. Recalling her fondness for honey-baked ham , she combined sugar and bacon to create dishes. [ 4 ] Perry realized that bacon could be used to add seasoning in flavoring dishes, including salads and pastas. [ 5 ] She observed that bacon increased the sweet and salty tastes of food. [ 6 ] Everything Tastes Better with Bacon was published in English in paperback format by Chronicle Books on May 1, 2002. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The book sold for a retail price of US$ 18.95 in its initial publication. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] A French paperback edition was published in 2004 by Les Editions de l'Homme, as part of its "Tout un plat!" ("What a dish!") series. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Content summary [ edit ] Sara Perry in 2009 Perry explains her feelings about bacon in the book's introduction, observing that its smell while cooking helps start her day and provide her with a sense of calmness. [ 13 ] The beginning of the book provides background on the phrase " bringing home the bacon ", introduces the reader to types of bacon and describes storage methods. [ 14 ] The book offers 70 recipes for bacon-flavored dishes, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] in nine chapters organized by topic, including breakfast, leaf vegetables, pasta meals, side dishes, party servings, desserts and appetizers . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Recipes include a bacon sandwich using other ingredients, [ 20 ] a bacon crunch topping for ice cream , [ 21 ] a bacon concoction to top a fruit crisp, [ 16 ] and a pie crust that incorporates bacon. [ 22 ] Methods are offered for cooking bacon on a stovetop , in an oven and under a griller to maximize its flavor and appearance. [ 19 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The book is illustrated with photographs by Sheri Giblin. [ 25 ] Reception [ edit ] Everything Tastes Better with Bacon was positively received by reviewers and food critics. The Chicago Tribune reported that it sold 30,000 copies in its first month. [ 22 ] Janet F. Keeler of the St. Petersburg Times commented positively on the book's title. [ 26 ] She noted the work was covered by food critics, who included its recipes in articles about the subject. [ 26 ] Keeler interviewed Fran McCullough, author of The Best American Recipes 2003–2004 , who posited that the Atkins diet (which emphasizes higher meat consumption as part of a low carbohydrate plan [ 27 ] ) had helped increase the popularity of bacon usage. [ 26 ] She classed it among the "most interesting and unique cookbooks" published. [ 28 ] Giblin's photography received favorable commentary from Cindy Hoedel of The Kansas City Star . [ 25 ] Literary critic Dwight Garner of The New York Times included the book in a list of favorites among recent cooking publications. [ 29 ] The review was critical of the author's dessert recipes, but agreed with her overall argument for increased use of bacon in cooking. [ 29 ] The Arizona Daily Star highlighted the book in their "Hot Reads" section. [ 30 ] Assistant Texas Taste Editor for The Dallas Morning News Laura H. Ehret wrote that the book successfully conveys the experience of consuming bacon. [ 31 ] Marty Meitus wrote for the Rocky Mountain News that the book had increased his appetite for bacon dishes. [ 32 ] Meitus recommended dessert recipes, including Hazelnut -Bacon Candy Crunch, Peanut Butter Cookies with Bacon Brittle, Pear - Apple Crisp with Brown Sugar-Bacon Topping and Ruby Raisin Mincemeat Tart . [ 32 ] Steve Smith, executive chef at Dixon's Downtown Grill in Denver , was inspired by Perry's "Maple Sundae" recipe and used it to create his own macadamia -bacon crunch ice cream dessert. [ 33 ] Writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , Marlene Parrish gave the book a favorable review, highlighting it in her article "Favorite Cookbooks for 2002". [ 34 ] She wrote that she enjoyed sampling the recipes from the book. [ 34 ] Parrish added that Robert Atkins , creator of the Atkins diet, would think favorably of the " Gorgonzola Cheeseburgers with Bacon" dish. [ 34 ] The Denver Post included the book in a list of best cookbooks of 2002. [ 35 ] Another article for the same newspaper highlighted recipes in the book, including Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Cobb salad , Pear-Apple Crisp with Brown Sugar-Bacon Topping and Bacon Brittle. [ 36 ] A review in the Toronto Star criticized Perry's lack of creativity in her choice of recipes. [ 37 ] The review concluded the book was a good deal compared to other cookbooks on the subject, while noting its lack of comprehensiveness with the small number of total recipes included. [ 37 ] Michele Anna Jordan of The Press Democrat recommended Perry's work, and commented that the author's zest for the subject was contagious. [ 38 ] Impact [ edit ] According to the Chicago Sun-Times and the St. Petersburg Times , Everything Tastes Better with Bacon is a niche work in the cookbook genre. [ 18 ] [ 28 ] Perry stated that bacon had undergone a renaissance period. [ 10 ] Christian Science Monitor noted in a 2003 article that bacon was becoming an increasingly used cooking ingredient, despite having been maligned by nutritionists. [ 10 ] Recipes from the book were selected for inclusion in The Best American Recipes 2003–2004: The Year's Top Picks from Books, Magazines, Newspapers and the Internet . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Perry's recipe for "Succulent Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp" was referenced in the 2003 book Smoke & Spice: Cooking with Smoke, the Real Way to Barbecue . [ 41 ] Fran McCullough, the author of The Best American Recipes , commented that the book was a surprising addition to the field. [ 26 ] The Atlantic said that three years after the book's publication, bacon had become as popular as chocolate or olive oil. [ 42 ] Leah A. Zeldes observed in a 2006 article for the Chicago Sun-Times that the book contributed to the body of works that display the adaptability of bacon in recipes. [ 18 ] In his 2009 book Hungry Monkey , author Matthew Amster-Burton commented on the phenomena involving bacon and books on the subject in prior years, listing the book along with The Bacon Cookbook and Seduced by Bacon . [ 43 ] A 2013 article in the British newspaper The Independent cited the book as an example of increasing interest in pork.
