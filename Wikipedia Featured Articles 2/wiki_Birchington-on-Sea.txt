It is part of the Thanet district and forms part of the civil parish of Birchington. It lies on the coast facing the North Sea , east of the Thames Estuary , between the seaside resorts of Herne Bay and Margate . As a seaside resort , the village is a tourist and retirement destination. The village's Minnis Bay is a family beach with attractions such as sailing, windsurfing, a paddling pool and coastal walking routes. Its three smaller beaches are surrounded by chalk cliffs, cliff stacks and caves. The village was first recorded in 1240. Its parish church, All Saints', dates to the 13th century and its churchyard is the burial place of the 19th-century Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti . Quex Park , a local 19th-century manor house, is home to the Powell-Cotton Museum and a twelve-bell tower built for change ringing . The museum contains a large collection of stuffed exotic animals collected by Major Percy Powell-Cotton on his travels in Africa, and also houses artefacts unearthed in and around Birchington by his daughter, Antoinette Powell-Cotton, a keen archeologist.

[ 1 ] Archaeological evidence has shown the area was inhabited before the existence of the village: Roman and prehistoric artefacts have been discovered in the area, and Minnis Bay was once the site of an Iron Age settlement. [ 2 ] All Saints' Church dates to around 1350 Archives show the village's All Saints' Church dates to around 1350. [ 3 ] In the early 15th century, Quex Park manor house —named after the park's second owner, John Quek—was built just south of the village. [ 2 ] The ownership of the manor passed to various families until 1770 when it was acquired by the present owners, the Powell family. [ 4 ] In the late 17th century, the house was visited by King William III . [ 2 ] In 1565, a report on the coast of Thanet by the commissioners of Queen Elizabeth I stated that Birchington had 42 houses and did not have an active port. [ 5 ] Before the 19th century, the village coastline was frequented by smugglers, leading to skirmishes between them and excise officers. Several of the older houses in the village contain cellars and bricked up tunnels, once used for storing contraband. [ 2 ] The 1801 census recorded the village's population as 537. [ 6 ] In the early 19th century, the Tudor Quex House had to be demolished and a replacement manor house was built in its place. [ 4 ] In 1818, the Waterloo Tower was built on the grounds of Quex Park. It is a bell tower built by the owner of Quex Park, John Powell Powell, who had an interest in change ringing. Waterloo Tower was the first twelve-bell tower in Kent. [ 7 ] The village was a farming community until the late 19th century, when it began to develop into a coastal resort. Birchington railway station was opened in 1863 and the Railway Hotel, now the Sea View Hotel pub, was opened in 1865. Station Road was subsequently built to serve as Birchington's main shopping street. Coast Guard cottages were built at Minnis Bay in the 1870s and the first shops appeared by the bay in 1903. [ 2 ] Geography [ edit ] A dyke in the Wantsum channel marshland, between Birchington-on-Sea and Herne Bay Birchington-on-Sea is located at 51°22′37″N 1°18′18″E ﻿ / ﻿ 51.37694°N 1.30500°E ﻿ / 51.37694; 1.30500 (51.377, 1.305) in northeast Kent, on the coast of the Thames Estuary. The village is 14 kilometres (9 mi) to the east of Herne Bay and 6 kilometres (4 mi) to the west of Margate. The small town of Westgate-on-Sea lies between Birchington and Margate. The village is built beside four sandy bays; Minnis Bay to the west, Grenham Bay and Beresford Gap towards the centre and Epple Bay to the east. The village is situated on the Isle of Thanet , which was a separate island from mainland Kent until around two hundred years ago, when the channel in between became silted up. The area to the west of the village, between Birchington and Herne Bay, was once part of the channel and is now low-lying marshland. In the east of the village the land rises, forming chalk cliffs and cliff stacks around the beaches at Grenham Bay, Beresford Gap and Epple Bay. A sea wall stretches along the foot of the cliffs to prevent further erosion. The geology of Thanet consists mainly of chalk, deposited when the area was below the sea. Isle of Thanet became exposed above sea-level once the English Channel broke through between Kent and France, causing the sea-level to fall. [ 8 ] The whole of the northeast Kent coast has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest . [ 9 ] The drinking water in the village is classed as being ' very hard ', having just over 120 mg of calcium per litre. The hardness is due to water being obtained from underground chalk sources by the water company Southern Water . [ 10 ] Neighbouring towns, parishes and seas.
