[ 9 ] Lying in the Tualatin Valley on the west side of the Portland metropolitan area , the city hosts many high-technology companies, such as Intel , that comprise what has become known as the Silicon Forest . At the 2010 Census, the city's population was 91,611. [ 10 ] For thousands of years before the arrival of European-American settlers, the Atfalati tribe of the Kalapuya lived in the Tualatin Valley near the later site of Hillsboro. The climate, moderated by the Pacific Ocean, helped make the region suitable for fishing, hunting, food gathering, and agriculture. Settlers founded a community here in 1842, later named after David Hill , an Oregon politician. Transportation by riverboat on the Tualatin River was part of Hillsboro's settler economy. A railroad reached the area in the early 1870s and an interurban electric railway about four decades later. These railways, as well as highways, aided the slow growth of the city to about 2,000 people by 1910 and about 5,000 by 1950, before the arrival of high-tech companies in the 1980s. Hillsboro has a council–manager government consisting of a city manager and a city council headed by a mayor. In addition to high-tech industry, sectors important to Hillsboro's economy are health care, retail sales, and agriculture, including grapes and wineries . The city operates more than twenty parks and the mixed-use Hillsboro Stadium , and ten sites in the city are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Modes of transportation include private vehicles, public buses and light rail , and aircraft using the Hillsboro Airport . The city is home to Pacific University 's Health Professions Campus. Notable residents include two Oregon governors.

The valley consisted of open grassland maintained through annual burning by the Atfalati, with scattered groves of trees along the streams. The Kalapuya moved from place to place in good weather to fish and hunt and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included camas and wapato , and the Atfalati traded for salmon from Chinookan tribes near Willamette Falls on the Willamette River . During the winter, they lived in longhouses in settled villages, some near what became Hillsboro and Beaverton. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18th century with Europeans, who carried smallpox , syphilis , and malaria . Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000 Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the Grande Ronde reservation further west. [ 11 ] The European-American community was founded by David Hill, Isaiah Kelsey, and Richard Williams, who arrived in the Tualatin Valley in 1841, followed by six more pioneers in 1842. [ 12 ] The locality went by two other names—East Tualatin Plains and Columbia—before it was named "Hillsborough" in February 1850 in honor of Hill, when he sold part of his land claim to the county. [ 13 ] On February 5, 1850, commissioners chosen by the territorial legislature selected the community to be the seat of the county government. [ 13 ] Hill was to be paid $200 for his land after plots had been sold for the town site, [ 13 ] but he died before this occurred, and his widow Lucinda received the funds. [ 14 ] The town's name was later simplified to Hillsboro. A log cabin was built in 1853 to serve as the community's first school, which opened in October 1854. [ 15 ] Riverboats provided transportation to Hillsboro as early as 1867 when the side-wheel steamer Yamhill worked on the Tualatin River. [ 12 ] Shute Park sculpture In 1871, the Oregon and California Railroad line was extended to the area, but it ran just south of town because the city did not want to give the railroad land in exchange for the rail connection. [ 12 ] Hillsboro was incorporated as the Town of Hillsboro on October 19, 1876, by the Oregon Legislature . [ 16 ] The first mayor was A. Luelling, who took office on December 8, 1876, and served a one-year term. [ 17 ] Notable later mayors included Congressman Thomas H. Tongue (1882 and 1886) and state senator William D. Hare (1885). [ 17 ] In 1923, the city altered its charter and adopted a council-manager government with a six-person city council, a part-time mayor who determined major policies, and a city manager who ran day-to-day operations. [ 18 ] On September 30, 1908, 5,000 people gathered as the Oregon Electric Railway opened a connection between the city and Portland with an interurban electric rail line, the first to reach the community. [ 19 ] In January 1914, the Southern Pacific Railroad introduced its own interurban service, known as the Red Electric , on a separate line and serving different communities between Hillsboro and Portland. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] SP discontinued its Hillsboro service on July 28, 1929, [ 21 ] while the Oregon Electric Railway's passenger service to Hillsboro lasted until July 1932. [ 20 ] A brick building was constructed in 1852 to house the county government, followed by a brick courthouse in 1873. [ 22 ] In 1891, the courthouse was remodeled and a clock tower was added, [ 23 ] and the building was expanded with an annex in 1912. A new courthouse replaced the brick structure in 1928. The last major remodel of the 1928 structure occurred in 1972, when the Justice Services Building was built and incorporated into the existing building. [ 22 ] The city's first fire department was a hook and ladder company organized in 1880 by the board of trustees (now city council). [ 24 ] A drinking water and electricity distribution system added in 1892–93 gave the town three fire hydrants and minimal street lighting. [ 25 ] Hillsboro built its first sewer system in 1911, but sewage treatment was not added until 1936. [ 26 ] In 1913, the city built its own water system , [ 27 ] and the first library, Carnegie City Library , opened in December 1914. [ 28 ] From 1921 to 1952, the world's second-tallest radio tower stood on the south side of the city, [ 29 ] but in 1952, the wireless telegraph tower was demolished. In 1972, the Hillsboro City Council passed a Green River Ordinance banning door-to-door solicitation, but it was ruled unconstitutional by the Oregon Supreme Court in a 1988 decision. [ 30 ] The court determined that the city ordinance was overly broad, in a case that was seen as a test case for many similar laws in the state. [ 30 ] In 1979, Intel opened its first facility in Hillsboro. [ 31 ] The Hawthorn Farm campus was followed by the Jones Farm campus adjacent to the airport in 1982, and finally by the Ronler Acres campus in 1994. [ 31 ] TriMet opened a Metropolitan Area Express (MAX) light rail line into the city in 1998. A cultural center was added in 2004, and a new city hall was completed in 2005. In 2008, SolarWorld opened a facility producing solar wafers , crystals, and cells, the largest plant of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. [ 32 ] U.S. President Barack Obama visited the city and Intel's Ronler Acres campus in February 2011. [ 33 ] Registered Historic Places [ edit ] Properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in and around Hillsboro include the Old Scotch Church , completed in 1876 north of the city. [ 34 ] Near the Orenco neighborhood is Imbrie Farm , which includes a house built in 1866 and the Frank Imbrie Barn, both of which McMenamins converted for use as a brewpub . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Built in 1935, the Harold Wass Ray House is near Intel's Hawthorn Farm campus. [ 34 ] Historic properties in downtown include the Zula Linklater House (completed 1923), Rice–Gates House (1890), Edward Schulmerich House (c. 1915), and Charles Shorey House (c. 1908). [ 34 ] The Richard and Helen Rice House is adjacent to the Sunset Highway on the north side of the city and houses the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals. [ 34 ] The Old Washington County Jail previously was at the Washington County Fairgrounds in the city, [ 34 ] but was restored and moved to the Washington County Museum outside the city in 2004, and was de-listed from the NRHP in 2008. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] In 2007, the Manning–Kamna Farm was added to the NRHP and includes 10 buildings, dating to as early as 1883. [ 38 ] The Malcolm McDonald House in Orenco was added to the Registry in 2015. [ 39 ] Geography [ edit ] Map of Hillsboro and neighborhoods as of February 2008 Hillsboro is located at 45°31′N 122°59′W ﻿ / ﻿ 45.517°N 122.983°W ﻿ / 45.517; -122.983 ﻿ ( Hillsboro, Oregon ) . [ 7 ] The United States Census Bureau reports the city has a total area of 21.6 square miles (55.9 km 2 ), all of which is land. In 2013, Hillsboro itself reported an area of 23.88 square miles (61.8 km 2 ), equivalent to 15,283 acres (61.8 km 2 ). [ 40 ] The city is located in the Tualatin Valley , and the Tualatin River forms part of the southern city limits. The city's terrain is fairly level, consistent with an agricultural past and the farms still in operation. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Hillsboro is about 17 miles (27 km) west of Portland and immediately west of Beaverton , at an elevation of 194 feet (59 m) above sea level . [ 7 ] In addition to the Tualatin River, streams include Dairy Creek , McKay Creek, Rock Creek, Dawson Creek, and Turner Creek. Neighboring communities in addition to Beaverton are Aloha , Cornelius , North Plains , Reedville , Scholls , and West Union . Hillsboro's street system differs from many others in the county. [ 43 ] Most cities in Washington County use a numbering system and cardinal direction orientation based on a grid that begins at the Willamette River in downtown Portland, which was originally part of Washington County. [ 43 ] For example, the street names in Beaverton generally include Southwest (SW) prefixes because Beaverton lies in the southwest quadrant of the Portland grid. In Hillsboro, some county road names and addresses conform to the Portland grid instead of Hillsboro's internal cardinal direction grid, [ 44 ] and the city has been working to make addresses and streets within Hillsboro conform to the internal grid. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] The internal grid in Hillsboro centers on the downtown intersection of Main Street, which runs east–west, and First Avenue, which runs north–south. Most addresses within the city include a quadrant prefix: NW, NE, SW, or SE. Main Street is simply designated as East Main or West Main, and First Avenue is only North First or South First. [ 46 ] Addresses on the streets' south side and the avenues' east side have even numbers, while odd numbers are on the opposite side. [ 46 ] Hillsboro's street system contains 20 blocks per mile (12.5 blocks per kilometer). [ 46 ] North–south through roadways are called avenues , while east–west roadways are called streets . [ 47 ] All cul-de-sacs are named as either places or courts . [ 47 ] Roads that curve can be named drives . [ 47 ] Non-city streets may not conform to these naming conventions. [ 44 ] The city is divided into eight planning areas, each of which contains several neighborhoods. [ 48 ] The east planning area contains the Tanasbourne neighborhood and Oregon Health & Science University 's West Campus. [ 48 ] The northeast planning area includes the Orenco , Orenco Station , Airport, and West Union neighborhoods. [ 48 ] Jackson School, Sunrise, and Glencoe neighborhoods lie in the northwest area, [ 48 ] and the Dennis, Garibaldi, and Connell neighborhoods are in the west area. [ 48 ] The central area includes the Downtown, Jackson Bottom, Henry, and Eastwood neighborhoods. [ 48 ] Blocks in the downtown core are 400 feet (120 m) long on each side. [ 49 ] The Minter Bridge, Rood Bridge, and River Road neighborhoods are in the south planning area; [ 48 ] the southeast area consists of the Reedville and Witch Hazel neighborhoods, [ 48 ] and the Brookwood planning area in the center of the city contains the Cedar, Bentley, and Brogden neighborhoods. [ 48 ] Landmarks in Hillsboro include the Washington County Courthouse , the seat of county government. [ 50 ] Along the western edge of the city is Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery , established in 1870, which serves as the final resting place of city pioneers and politicians. [ 51 ] Next to the airport is the Washington County Fair Complex, home to the annual county fair. [ 52 ] Located at Shute Park is the 25-foot (7.6 m) tall wood sculpture Chief Kno-Tah , donated to Hillsboro and dedicated in 1987 as part of Peter Wolf Toth 's Trail of the Whispering Giants . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Climate [ edit ] Summers in Hillsboro are generally warm, but temperatures year-round are moderated by a marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. [ 57 ] The Willamette Valley in which Hillsboro lies receives the majority of its precipitation during the winter months, with the wettest period from November through March. [ 57 ] This occasionally includes snowfall. [ 58 ] Hillsboro receives precipitation on 161 days per year, on average. [ 59 ] The average yearly precipitation between 1930 and 1998 was 38 inches (970 mm). [ 60 ] August is the warmest month with an average high temperature of 81 °F (27 °C ), while January is the coolest month with an average high of 46 °F (8 °C). [ 61 ] The highest recorded temperature, 108 °F (42 °C), occurred on July 19, 1956, and the lowest, −10 °F (−23 °C), occurred on January 31, 1950. [ 61 ] According to the Köppen climate classification system, Hillsboro has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate ( Köppen Csb).

[ 66 ] By 1970, it had increased to more than 15,000, although neighboring Beaverton had overtaken it as the county's most populous city. [ 67 ] By 1990 there were more than 37,000 residents, and commuters raised this to 110,000 during daytime. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] At the 2010 Census, the population was 91,611, [ 10 ] fifth in rank among the state's largest cities behind Portland, Eugene , Salem and Gresham and slightly ahead of Beaverton, which ranked sixth. [ 70 ] This figure was a 30.5 percent increase from Hillsboro's 70,186 residents in 2000, which made Hillsboro the fourth fastest-growing city in the state during the 2000s (decade), and the fastest-growing city in the Willamette Valley over the same period. In 2007, there were 17,126 houses lived in by their owners, with an average home price in the city of $246,900. [ 71 ] Bloomberg Businessweek listed the city as the fastest-growing in Oregon for the period between 1990 and 2010, for cities with populations over 10,000.

[ 71 ] One example of a manufacturer headquartered in Hillsboro is Beaverton Foods, a family-owned condiment manufacturer since 1929, with 70+ employees and $25 million in annual sales; it moved to its current headquarters in 2001. [ 79 ] Retail employment constitutes 12%, construction makes up 7%, and 13% of workers are employed in the administrative, scientific, professional, or waste management industries. [ 71 ] Sixty-eight percent of workers commute alone to the workplace, and eight percent use public transportation. [ 71 ] The average one-way commute time is about 24 minutes. [ 71 ] Many technology companies operate in Hillsboro, making it the center of Oregon's Silicon Forest . [ 80 ] [ 81 ] In particular, Intel 's [ 82 ] largest site is in Hillsboro, and includes three large campuses: Ronler Acres, Jones Farm, and Hawthorn Farm, along with several smaller campuses that employ about 16,000 workers. [ 83 ] Other high-tech companies operating facilities in Hillsboro include Yahoo! , [ 84 ] Credence Systems, Synopsys, Epson, [ 85 ] Salesforce , [ 86 ] and Oracle's (formerly Sun Microsystems) High-End Operations. Hillsboro is the co-corporate headquarters for Qorvo (formerly TriQuint Semiconductor ), [ 83 ] RadiSys , and Planar Systems among others. [ 87 ] In 2006, Genentech announced plans to locate a packaging and distribution facility on 100 acres (0.40 km 2 ) in Hillsboro. [ 88 ] The $400 million facility opened in 2010, which Oregon officials hoped would eventually also be used for research and development for the biotechnology company. [ 89 ] Other biotech or medical companies based in Hillsboro include FEI Company and Acumed . [ 90 ] The city is also a landing point on three fiber optic cable systems linking the United States across the Pacific Ocean: C2C , Southern Cross Cable , and VSNL Transpacific . These cable landings, lower energy costs, and tax breaks led to a boom of data centers being built starting about 2010. [ 91 ] Data centers include those for Adobe, NetApp, Umpqua Bank , OHSU, and Fortune Data Centers. [ 91 ] Ronler Acres Intel campus Hillsboro serves as the corporate headquarters for Rodgers Instruments , Soloflex , Norm Thompson Outfitters , SureID , and Parr Lumber , among others. Fujitsu and NEC Corporation formerly had factories in Hillsboro. [ 92 ] Hillsboro is also home to the Laika stop-motion animation studio, creator of the Oscar-nominated feature films Coraline (2009) and Paranorman (2012). [ 93 ] The Hatfield Government Center in Hillsboro is the western terminus of the MAX Blue Line , part of the Portland metropolitan area's light-rail system.
