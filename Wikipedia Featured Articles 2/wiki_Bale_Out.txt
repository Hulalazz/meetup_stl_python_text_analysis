" is a satirical dance remix by American composer Lucian Piane , also known as RevoLucian, released on February 2, 2009, to YouTube and Myspace . The piece parodies Christian Bale by utilizing audio from a July 2008 rant made by the actor on the set of Terminator Salvation . Various other elements are used in the remix, including pulsating dance track beats and clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of then- President George W. Bush , creating the impression of Streisand arguing with Bale. The day after its release, the YouTube page for the song had been viewed over 200,000 times, and over a million times by February 5, 2009. The Associated Press called it a "hypnotic dance track", [ 1 ] and United Press International noted it was "catchy", characterizing it as a "YouTube sensation". [ 2 ] Gil Kaufman of MTV.com described the piece as "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party". [ 3 ] Time magazine's website called the track "hilarious", [ 4 ] and Nine News characterized it as a "raging online success". [ 5 ] The director of Terminator Salvation McG liked the remix and put a copy of it on his iPod , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and Bale said he had heard the remix and thought "they did a good job".

The film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut , walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. [ 10 ] [ 12 ] Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident. [ 10 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The website TMZ.com reported the occurrence soon after it happened, [ 16 ] and posted an audio recording on February 2, 2009. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The event did not become widely publicized until after TMZ.com had posted the audio of Bale's outburst. [ 16 ] TMZ.com reported that film executives for Terminator Salvation sent a copy of the audio recording to the film's insurance company, in case Bale refused to continue filming. [ 10 ] [ 13 ] Four days after the audio recording was posted to the Internet, Bale appeared as a guest on Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM , where he was asked about the altercation. [ 17 ] He said he "acted like a punk", and that he and Hurlbut talked after the conflict and "resolved this completely". [ 17 ] Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the episode, and "at least a month after that", and noted, "I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job. It looks fantastic." [ 17 ] Composition [ edit ] Lucian Piane (2009) Prior to the release of Bale Out, Lucian Piane was known for a variety of satirical remixes, including tracks featuring Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , political commentator Bill O'Reilly during an on-camera outburst in the 1980s, and Andrew Meyer , who received national media attention when he was tasered by police during a speech given by U.S. Senator John Kerry at the University of Florida . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Associated Press reported that Piane was "drawn to the musicality of Bale's rage-filled voice". [ 1 ] Piane spent three hours working on the remix. [ 6 ] "When I heard Christian Bale flip out I had to remix the track. ... It's good to hear that clubs have already started playing it as it is very funny," said Piane. [ 18 ] In an interview with LA Weekly , Piane commented that he wants his remix remembered, instead of Bale's outburst: "We're all people in this world. So I figured, [instead of] remembering that one time Christian Bale went crazy on set, maybe people will remember the remix." [ 6 ] The "Bale Out" mashup incorporates audio clips of Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding "I was looking at the lights." [ 5 ] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying "it's fucking distracting", [ 19 ] and "What don't you fuckin' understand?". [ 6 ] The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush , [ 3 ] [ 20 ] making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. [ 5 ] Piane told the Associated Press: "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." [ 1 ] Release [ edit ] Piane uploaded the piece to MySpace and YouTube on February 2, 2009, [ 1 ] hours after the original clip of Bale appeared on the internet. [ 5 ] Piane made an MP3 file of "Bale Out" available as a free download from his MySpace page. [ 18 ] "Bale Out" had been viewed over 200,000 times one day after it was uploaded to YouTube, [ 1 ] and within two days it had received 700,000 hits. [ 18 ] Three days after its posting, "Bale Out" had been viewed over one million times on YouTube, [ 5 ] and over 1.5 million times after one week. [ 19 ] In a report on the remix for The Situation Room on CNN , correspondent Brooke Anderson noted "... by the looks of this musical parody already posted on YouTube, this infamous rant will be talked about – for a long time to come." [ 21 ] Anderson Cooper of Anderson Cooper 360° described the RevoLucian remix as "the ballistic Bale boogie". [ 22 ] A piece in Vue Weekly posed the question "what does it all mean in the end when a remixed diatribe by a Hollywood star will get way more hits in a day than any film-criticism site in a year?" [ 23 ] Reception [ edit ] LA Weekly reported that McG , the director of Terminator Salvation , had a copy of "Bale Out" on his iPod . [ 6 ] "And I have to admit, that dance remix [on YouTube] is pretty hot," said McG in an interview with Fast Company . [ 7 ] In an interview with E!: Entertainment Television to discuss Terminator: Salvation , Christian Bale said he had heard the remix and commented: "It was a good remix; they did a good job." [ 8 ] Bale said he had received a remix of his outburst from a friend: "They did a bloody good job! I've gotta say, what a great impulse, you know? To take something ugly like that and make it into a dance? That's a wonderful thing." [ 9 ] "Music producer Lucian Piane ... remixed the verbal freak-out into a three-minute-long hypnotic dance track ..." — Associated Press [ 1 ] The Associated Press described the piece as a "hypnotic dance track", "beat-driven", and a "pulsating tune". [ 1 ] The AP noted "Bale has become an unwitting music sensation because of the incident." [ 1 ] A Los Angeles Times blog described "Bale Out" as "a genius piece of mixing by L.A.'s very own RevoLucian", [ 24 ] and called the piece a "brilliant" club remix. [ 25 ] MTV.com called it "a techno-ripping, demonic dance party in which Bale's berating is repeated ad nauseam under pictures of the actor and random f-bomb interjections from Barbra Streisand". [ 3 ] United Press International characterized the remix as a "YouTube sensation", calling it "catchy". [ 2 ] LA Weekly described the remix as "a mash-up of Bale's best quotes set to a synth-heavy beat", and noted "'Bale Out' turned 'What don't you fuckin' understand?' into one of the year's most addictive choruses and spun a little art out of the debacle." [ 6 ] The Irish Independent called the piece a "painstakingly constructed dance track", and described the chorus as "oddly catchy". [ 19 ] The Globe and Mail commented that the remix has "an imperilling beat, a genius comedic flair and more sheer scariness than American Psycho and Terminator combined". [ 26 ] The Wall Street Journal wrote that Piane combined Bale's language with "a driving house music track". [ 27 ] TIME magazine's website described the piece as "a hilarious YouTube musical remix". [ 4 ] Nine News called RevoLucian's piece a "cheeky remix" and a "raging online success". [ 5 ] The Daily Telegraph in London highlighted the RevoLucian piece among the "Best of the mash-ups and spoofs" of the Bale outburst, noting he arranged the audio clips from Bale into a "potential dancefloor success". [ 28 ] Dose magazine commented "We've been throwing light-switch raves to the RevoLucian mix all week," [ 29 ] and BlackBook Magazine described it as "a brilliant club mix of Bale's meltdown that's bound to scream in your head all day". [ 30 ] The A.V. Club called the piece "a Hater-worthy techno remix", [ 31 ] and The Celebrity Cafe commented "Revolucian's remix must have had techno artists everywhere sweating to come up with something half as good, and likely inspired a few outlandish requests by club goers." [ 32 ] North Carolina State University doctoral student Matt Morain commented on the remixes spawned by Bale's rant, in an April 2009 paper on Internet memes . [ 33 ] Morain noted that remixes of Bale's rant received more hits than the rant itself, "What is more surprising than the nearly two million views is that a number of remixes appeared, in response to the clip, which have substantially higher view-counts than the original. In this process of remixing we can clearly see the elements of fantasy theme and rhetorical transmission." [ 33 ] Perez Hilton commented, "Once again, Lucian Piane has outdone himself! You must listen to this." [ 34 ] Hilton posted a video to his blog of himself dancing to Piane's remix. [ 35 ] On November 17, 2009, Piane's remix received a nomination for "Best Remix of the Year" by the website Urlesque . [ 36 ] The website's staff noted the Piane remix "spread like wildfire", and became an Internet phenomenon . [ 36 ] Piane's remix was one of five nominations; [ 36 ] it lost to the "Slap Chop Rap" parodying Vince Offer . [ 37 ] "Bale Out" was a finalist in the category of "Latest Favorite Viral Video", in the "2009 Best of Clicker Awards"; the winner was " David After Dentist ". [ 38 ] [ 39 ] "Bale Out" was nominated for a Webby Award in 2010, in the category of "Best Video Remixes/Mashups". [ 40 ] [ 41 ] The 2010 winner in the category for the Webby was " Auto-Tune the News ".
