[ 4 ] Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. [ 5 ] The family relocated to Bangalore , India, when Padukone was a year old. [ 6 ] She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School , and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College . [ 7 ] She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology, but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career. [ 6 ] [ 8 ] Padukone with her parents and sister at the 59th Filmfare Awards in 2014 Padukone has admitted to being socially awkward as a child, and did not have many friends. [ 6 ] The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework and go to sleep." [ 6 ] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years, and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. [ 9 ] While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. [ 10 ] In the tenth grade , she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [ 11 ] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Early in her career, Padukone gained recognition with a television commercial for the soap Liril , and modelled for various other brands and products. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2005, she made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Suneet Varma , and won the "Model of the Year" award at the Kingfisher Fashion Awards. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Padukone's fame increased when she appeared in a highly popular print campaign for the 2006 Kingfisher Calendar ; [ 17 ] the designer Wendell Rodricks commented, "Since Aishwarya Rai , we haven't had a girl as beautiful and fresh." [ 18 ] Rodricks had spotted her at a Ganjam jewellery class he was teaching and signed her up with the Matrix agency. [ 19 ] At the age of 21, Padukone relocated to Mumbai and stayed at her aunt's home. [ 6 ] That year, she gained wider recognition by featuring in the music video for Himesh Reshammiya 's song "Naam Hai Tera." [ 20 ] Padukone soon began to receive offers for film roles. [ 21 ] Believing herself to be too inexperienced as an actor, she instead enrolled for a course at Anupam Kher 's film academy. [ 22 ] Following much media speculation, the director Farah Khan , who had noticed her in Reshammiya's music video, made the decision to cast her for a role in Happy New Year . [ 6 ] [ 17 ] Acting career Film debut and breakthrough (2006–09) Padukone announced in 2006 that she would make her film debut with Aishwarya , a Kannada film directed by Indrajit Lankesh . [ 17 ] The romantic comedy was a remake of the Telugu film Manmadhudu , and she was cast in the titular role opposite the actor Upendra . The film proved a major commercial success. [ 23 ] RG Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com was appreciative of Padukone's screen presence but added that "she needs to work on her emotional scenes." [ 24 ] By the end of 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007). [ 25 ] Set against the backdrop of the Hindi film industry , the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved, and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual roles—Shantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, "I've grown up watching [Shah Rukh] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him ... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him." [ 26 ] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt "were more graceful" and "completely different from today's actors." [ 27 ] However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty . [ 28 ] For one of the songs in the film, "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley , "mesmeriz[ed] audiences" by using hasta mudras (hand gestures). [ 29 ] Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year , with a global revenue of ₹ 1.49 billion (US$22 million). [ 30 ] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, "Deepika has all it takes to be a top star—the personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as [Shah Rukh] and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air!" [ 31 ] At the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony, Padukone was awarded the Best Female Debut Award and received her first nomination in the Best Actress category. [ 32 ] Padukone at the first look launch of Love Aaj Kal , 2009 Bollywood Hungama reported that the success of Om Shanti Om proved a breakthrough for Padukone. [ 33 ] She followed this success with the role of Gayatri (one of star Ranbir Kapoor 's love interests), a feisty student in Australia who moonlights as a cab driver in Yash Raj Films ' romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008). The film was a financial success, [ 34 ] but Namrata Joshi of Outlook wrote that Padukone's performance was disappointing: "She is mannequin-like and utterly lacks fire and zing." [ 35 ] Padukone's first release of 2009 came alongside Akshay Kumar in the Nikhil Advani -directed kung fu comedy Chandni Chowk To China , in which she portrayed the dual roles of Indian-Chinese twin sisters Sakhi and Suzy. Produced by Warner Bros. , it had one of the widest international releases ever given to an Indian film. [ 36 ] Padukone learned the Japanese martial art form of jujutsu , and performed her stunts without the use of a body double. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Despite the hype, Chandni Chowk To China proved a major financial failure with worldwide earnings of ₹ 554.7 million (US$8.2 million) on a budget of ₹ 800 million (US$12 million). [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Film critics were generally disappointed with the picture and Padukone's performance; [ 41 ] Justin Trout of Orlando Weekly noted that she "is so wasted in Chandni Chowk , my mind often wandered back to Om Shanti Om during her scenes, possibly as a defense mechanism." [ 42 ] That same year, Padukone featured in an item number (for a song called "Love Mera Hit Hit") in the drama Billu , [ 43 ] following which she appeared alongside Saif Ali Khan in the romantic drama Love Aaj Kal from the writer-director Imtiaz Ali . The film documented the changing value of relationships among the youth, and had Padukone play the part of Meera Pandit, a head-strong career woman . With a worldwide gross of ₹ 1.2 billion (US$18 million), Love Aaj Kal proved to be the third highest-grossing film of 2009 . [ 30 ] Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis said that Padukone "delivers the best of her four performances so far" and Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India mentioned her as "definitive and strong." [ 44 ] [ 45 ] At the 55th Filmfare Awards Padukone received a nomination for Best Actress. [ 46 ] Career struggles (2010–11) Padukone had five film releases in 2010. Her first role was in Vijay Lalwani's psychological thriller Karthik Calling Karthik , where Padukone was cast as the supportive girlfriend of a depressed man (played by Farhan Akhtar ) who goes through a series of changes after receiving mysterious phone calls every morning. Derek Elley of Variety found the film to be "thinly plotted" but added that "the uncomplicated ingenuousness of Padukone ... helps make the tall tale convincing." [ 47 ] Commercially, the film performed poorly. [ 48 ] Her most economically profitable film that year was Sajid Khan 's ₹ 1.15 billion (US$17 million)-grossing comedy film Housefull in which she featured alongside an ensemble cast including Akshay Kumar, Ritesh Deshmukh , Lara Dutta , Arjun Rampal , Jiah Khan and Boman Irani . [ 30 ] Raja Sen described the film as a "festival of bad acting" and attributed Padukone's poor performance to her "plasticky expressions." [ 49 ] Padukone at a promotional event for Lafangey Parindey , 2010 Pradeep Sarkar 's drama Lafangey Parindey (2010) saw Padukone star opposite Neil Nitin Mukesh in the role of Pinky Palkar, a blind girl determined to win a skating competition. In preparation for her role, she observed the interactions of blind people and rehearsed scenes while blindfolded. [ 50 ] Writing for The Hindu , Sudhish Kamath was particularly impressed by Padukone and wrote that she "exercises considerable restraint" in playing her part. [ 51 ] Later that year, Hindustan Times published that the film helped change people's perception of Padukone, with focus directed on her acting prowess rather than her appearance. [ 52 ] Her next role was opposite Imran Khan in the Danish Aslam -directed romantic comedy Break Ke Baad . CNN-IBN 's Rajeev Masand found the film to be "reasonably engaging" and noted that it was "watchable largely for the performance of its leading lady." [ 53 ] Both Lafangey Parindey and Break Ke Baad underperformed at the box office. [ 48 ] Padukone's final release of 2010 was Ashutosh Gowarikar 's period film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey opposite Abhishek Bachchan . Based on the book Do and Die by Manini Chatterjee, the film is a retelling of the 1930 Chittagong armoury raid . [ 54 ] Bachchan featured as the revolutionary leader Surya Sen and Padukone played Kalpana Dutta , his confidante. [ 55 ] Padukone said that she did not research for the role as there were "hardly ... any reference points as to what Kalpana looked like other than a few photos," and relied completely on Gowarikar's direction. [ 56 ] A review published in The Telegraph was appreciative of Padukone's portrayal, and the film received a generally positive critical reception. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] Despite this, it proved a major commercial disappointment. [ 59 ] Padukone began 2011 with an item number in Rohan Sippy 's Dum Maaro Dum . The song was a remixed version of the iconic song " Dum Maro Dum ," from the 1971 film Hare Rama Hare Krishna , which featured Zeenat Aman . [ 60 ] Padukone referred to it as "the wildest song any actress has done;" the song's "suggestive lyrics" and "raunchy moves" attracted controversy including a court case for indecency. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Her next film was Prakash Jha 's socio-political drama Aarakshan , co-starring Amitabh Bachchan , Saif Ali Khan, Manoj Bajpayee and Prateik Babbar , which dealt with the political issue of caste-based reservations in India . Trade journalists had high expectations for the film which ultimately flopped at the box office. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Critical reaction was largely negative, though Pratim D. Gupta mentioned Padukone as the most "refreshing thing about [the] movie." [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Her final appearance that year was in Rohit Dhawan's comedy-drama Desi Boyz alongside Akshay Kumar, John Abraham and Chitrangada Singh , a role that failed to propel her career forward. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] The series of poorly received films led critics to perceive that Padukone had "[lost] her sparkle." [ 69 ] Establishing with Cocktail (2012–14) In an interview for The Indian Express , Padukone said that her starring role in the 2012 Homi Adajania -directed romantic comedy Cocktail marked a significant turning point in her career. [ 70 ] Raja Sen of Rediff.com opined that she had successfully proved to be a "stunning girl who can also act." [ 71 ] Set in London, Cocktail tells the story of a software engineer (played by Saif Ali Khan) and his relationship with two temperamentally different women—an impulsive party girl (Veronica, played by Padukone) and a submissive girl next door (Meera, played by Diana Penty ). During the script narration, the producer Dinesh Vijan offered Padukone the choice of which woman to play; she decided on Veronica to expand her horizons as an actress. [ 72 ] Portraying the role was a creative and physical challenge for her, and to achieve the physical requirements of her character she exercised extensively and followed a rigorous diet. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but particularly praised Padukone's performance; [ 75 ] Devesh Sharma of Filmfare credited her as the "soul of the film" and wrote that she "excels in every scene, whether as a material girl who enjoys sex, drugs and rock and roll or as the jealousy ridden girl out to destroy herself." [ 76 ] Cocktail earned Padukone Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare, Screen , and IIFA . [ 77 ] The film proved a box office hit as well. [ 78 ] In 2013, Padukone established herself as a leading actress of contemporary Hindi cinema by featuring in four of the top-grossing productions of the year . [ 79 ] [ 80 ] She collaborated with Saif Ali Khan for the fourth time (alongside John Abraham, Jacqueline Fernandez , Ameesha Patel , and Anil Kapoor ) in Abbas-Mustan 's Race 2 , an ensemble action thriller that served as a sequel to the 2008 film Race . The film received predominantly negative reviews from critics, [ 81 ] but with a total collection of ₹ 1.62 billion (US$24 million), it proved to be a commercial success. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] In a particularly scathing review, Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote that both Padukone and Fernandez "strut around like wound-up automatons that are all decked-up but have nowhere to go." [ 84 ] Padukone at a screening of Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela in 2013. She was awarded her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film Ayan Mukerji 's romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani was Padukone's next film release. Co-starring alongside Ranbir Kapoor, Kalki Koechlin , and Aditya Roy Kapoor , she was cast as Naina Talwar, a "shy wallflower," which marked a departure from the glamorous characters that she had a reputation for portraying. [ 85 ] Film critics praised Padukone's performance, though their response to the film was mixed. [ 86 ] [ 87 ] Raja Sen thought that the film "lacked a good story" but added that Padukone "acts within herself and eschews exaggeration, and the results are impressive ... This may be her most self-aware performance so far". [ 88 ] The pairing of Padukone with her former boyfriend was highly anticipated, [ 89 ] and the film proved a major success with a worldwide revenue of ₹ 3.02 billion (US$44 million). [ 82 ] [ 90 ] Her next appearance was opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Rohit Shetty 's action-comedy film Chennai Express . She played Meenalochini Azhagusundaram, a Tamil girl on the run from her father (a local don ), which required that she adopt a Tamil accent. Critical opinion on her accent was mixed, [ 91 ] but her performance received praise; [ 86 ] film critic Aseem Chhabra concluded, "Padukone is delightful in the film—beautiful, smiling, and often a lot more playful and funny than Khan." [ 92 ] Chennai Express was Padukone's second consecutive release to earn over ₹ 3 billion (US$44 million) in worldwide ticket sales; both Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Chennai Express rank among the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time . [ 82 ] [ 93 ] Padukone next played opposite Ranveer Singh in Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela , an adaptation of the Shakespearean tragedy of Romeo and Juliet from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali . Her role was Leela, a Gujarati girl based on the character of Juliet . [ 94 ] Initially titled Ram-Leela , the film's title was changed after a court case was registered against Bhansali, Padukone, and Singh for "offending the religious sentiments" of the Hindu community by showcasing sex and violence under a title that referred to the life of Lord Rama . [ 95 ] Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela released among protests across several states in India, but was generally well received by critics. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Meena Iyer of The Times of India mentioned Padukone as "breathtaking", and writing for Deccan Chronicle , Khalid Mohamed concluded that "it’s Deepika Padukone whom the film belongs to. Looking drop dead gorgeous and going at her part with a wallop, she’s the prime asset of Ram-Leela ." [ 98 ] [ 99 ] The film earned ₹ 2.02 billion (US$30 million) worldwide, making it Padukone's fourth consecutive box office hit of the year. [ 80 ] [ 83 ] Her performances in Chennai Express and Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela won her several awards, [ 100 ] including the Screen Award for Best Actress for both films and the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the latter. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] In 2014, Padukone featured opposite Rajinikanth in the Tamil film Kochadaiiyaan , a period drama that was shot using motion capture technology. [ 103 ] In Homi Adajania's widely praised satire Finding Fanny , Padukone played a young widow who takes a road trip with her dysfunctional friends (played by Arjun Kapoor , Naseeruddin Shah , Dimple Kapadia and Pankaj Kapur ) in search of a woman named Fanny. [ 104 ] The film was screened at the 19th Busan International Film Festival ; [ 105 ] critic Anuj Kumar of The Hindu wrote that Padukone successfully "takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance". [ 106 ] Farah Khan's renewal of Happy New Year saw Padukone work with Shah Rukh Khan for the third time. She played a bar dancer who trains a group of underachievers for a dance competition. Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found her role to be of minimal importance that required her only to be "a pretty thing to be laughed at and pitied". [ 107 ] The film earned over ₹ 3.4 billion (US$50 million), emerging a major financial success. [ 108 ] Piku and beyond (2015–present) Padukone at an event for Piku in 2015. She won a second Filmfare Award for Best Actress for the film Following an appearance in an online video on feminism , entitled My Choice , under the direction of Homi Adajania, [ 109 ] Padukone took on the role of a Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan) in Shoojit Sircar 's comedy-drama Piku (2015). Reviews for the film were positive; [ 110 ] Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves "what she is capable of when given something more to do than look pretty and be the crazy-dance girl at parties". [ 111 ] NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she "holds Piku together with a restrained star turn". [ 112 ] With a worldwide gross of over ₹ 1.40 billion (US$21 million), the film emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen. [ 108 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ] Later that year, Padukone played a businessperson who develops an attraction towards Ranbir Kapoor's character in Imtiaz Ali's Tamasha . Despite poor financial returns, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com named Padukone's performance as the best by an actress that year, writing that she "is so potent in Tamasha , it’s almost as if you can hear her heartbeat across the screen." [ 115 ] [ 116 ] In her final release of 2015, Padukone reunited with Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Ranveer Singh for the period romance Bajirao Mastani . Singh was cast as the maratha general Bajirao I , while Priyanka Chopra and Padukone featured as his first and second wife, respectively. In preparation for the role of the warrior-princess Mastani , Padukone learnt sword-fighting, horse-riding and kalaripayattu . [ 117 ] With a revenue of over ₹ 3.3 billion (US$49 million), Bajirao Mastani proved to be the fourth highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year . [ 118 ] Anupama Chopra found Padukone "riveting" in the film, and Subhash K. Jha wrote that "she is as statuesque as Madhubala , riding horses and destiny with equal grace and dignity", but noted that she "is way too subtle and silken, and not steely enough as [a] firebrand warrior-princess". [ 119 ] [ 120 ] At the 61st Filmfare Awards , Padukone received a second Best Actress nomination for the film, while Bajirao Mastani won nine awards, including Best Film . [ 113 ] [ 121 ] As of February 2016, Padukone is filming for her first project in Hollywood —the action film xXx: The Return of Xander Cage —in which she plays the lead female role opposite Vin Diesel . [ 122 ] [ 123 ] Personal life and off-screen work Padukone with Ranbir Kapoor at a promotional event for Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani in 2013 Padukone shares a close bond with her family, and visits them regularly in her hometown of Bangalore. [ 124 ] She lives by herself in Prabhadevi , a neighbourhood in Mumbai, and admits to missing the presence of her family there. [ 6 ] [ 125 ] She says, "I miss them, but luckily I have a life of my own, which keeps me from getting homesick. I wouldn’t want them to uproot their lives from Bengaluru just to be with me." [ 126 ] A practicing Hindu , Padukone considers religion to be an important aspect of her life and makes frequent visits to temples and other religious shrines. [ 127 ] She has also been outspoken on issues such as feminism and has said, "New feminism isn't about being aggressive; it's about reaching the top yet being soft. It's about being you — feminine, strong and full of will power.” [ 128 ] In a 2015 interview, Padukone spoke about her personal experience of overcoming depression , and in October that year she launched a foundation to create awareness on mental health in India, named "Live Love Laugh". [ 129 ] [ 130 ] While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began a romantic relationship with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. [ 131 ] She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the nape of her neck. [ 132 ] She has said that the relationship had a profound effect on her, transforming her into a more confident and social person. [ 6 ] The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years. [ 133 ] The couple broke up a year later; [ 134 ] she professed in an interview to feeling "angry" and "betrayed" for a long time, but insisted that they remained on good terms. [ 6 ] In a 2010 interview, Padukone made a comment that the media speculated was a reference to her break-up with Kapoor: [ 135 ] The first time he cheated on me, I thought there was something wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back. That ship has sailed. [ 136 ] Padukone performing at the "SLAM! The Tour" concert in 2014 Kapoor initially denied the allegations, but according to The Times of India , he later admitted to the infidelity. [ 137 ] In 2013, following the production of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani , Padukone told Filmfare that she now "shares a great comfort level" with him. [ 138 ] In 2011, a set of pictures showing Padukone kissing the cricket manager Siddharth Mallya at an Indian Premier League match were made available on the web. [ 139 ] This led to wide speculation in the media about the nature of their relationship, [ 140 ] which Padukone declined to talk about publicly. The following year there were reports about a break-up, to which she said: "Just because we are not seen together, it doesn't mean that we are not friends anymore." [ 141 ] She has since denied reports of other link-ups, stating that she is "not in a frame of mind to be in a relationship." [ 142 ] In addition to acting, Padukone has written opinion columns and has been involved with women's health and fitness magazines.
