Spread over 34,267 sq mi (88,750 km 2 ), it is bordered by the countries of Bangladesh , Nepal and Bhutan , and the Indian states of Odisha , Jharkhand , Bihar , Sikkim , and Assam . The state capital is Kolkata . Together with the neighboring nation of Bangladesh , it makes up the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal . Ancient Bengal was the site of several major janapadas (kingdoms). It was also part of large empires such as the Maurya Empire (second century BC) and Gupta Empire (fourth century AD); and part of the regional Buddhist Pala Empire (8th to 11th century) and Sena dynasty (11th–12th century). From the 13th century onward, the region was controlled by the Bengal Sultanate , Hindu kings and Baro-Bhuyan landlords under the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire , until the British East India company took control of the region from the Mughals in the late 18th century. The company consolidated their hold on the region following the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and Battle of Buxar in 1764 and by 1793 took complete control of the region. Kolkata (or Calcutta) served for many years as the capital of British controlled territories in India . The early and prolonged exposure to British administration resulted in the expansion of Western education, culminating in development of science, institutional education, and social reforms in the region, including what became known as the Bengali renaissance . A hotbed of the Indian independence movement through the early 20th century, Bengal was divided during India's independence in 1947 along religious lines into two separate entities: West Bengal—a state of India—and East Bengal —a part of the newly created Dominion of Pakistan that later became the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971. A major agricultural producer , West Bengal is the sixth-largest contributor to India's net domestic product . [ 3 ] Noted for its political activism , the state was ruled by democratically elected communist governments for 34 years from 1977. It is noted for its cultural activities and the presence of cultural and educational institutions; the state capital Kolkata is known as the "cultural capital of India". The state's cultural heritage, besides varied folk traditions, ranges from stalwarts in literature including Nobel-laureate Rabindranath Tagore to scores of musicians, film-makers and artists. West Bengal is also distinct from most other Indian states in its appreciation and practice of playing Association football besides cricket, the national favourite sport.

One theory suggests that the word derives from "Bang", a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000 BC. [ 7 ] The word might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of Vanga (or Banga ). Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name, the region's early history is obscure. At the end of British Rule over the Indian subcontinent , the Bengal region was partitioned in 1947 along religious lines into east and west. The east came to be known as East Bengal and the west came to known as West Bengal which remained as an Indian state . In 2011, the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name for the state to Poschimbongo ( Bengali : পশ্চিমবঙ্গ Pôshchimbônggô ) [ 8 ] [ 9 ] which reflects the native name of the state, literally meaning western Bengal in the native Bengali language. History Main articles: History of Bengal and History of West Bengal Stone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state. [ 10 ] The region was a part of the Vanga Kingdom according to the Indian epic Mahabharata . [ 11 ] Several Vedic realms were present in Bengal region, including Vanga , Rarh , Pundravardhana and the Suhma Kingdom . One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100 BC of a land named Gangaridai , which was located at the mouths of the Ganges. [ 12 ] Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi (Burma, Lower Thailand, Lower Malay Peninsula , and the Sumatra ). [ 13 ] According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa , Prince Vijaya , a Vanga Kingdom prince, conquered Lanka (modern day Sri Lanka) and gave the name Sinhala Kingdom to the country. [ 14 ] Era of the janapadas The kingdom of Magadha was formed in 7th century BCE, consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal . It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira , founder of Jainism , and Gautama Buddha , founder of Buddhism , and consisted of several janapadas or kingdoms. [ 15 ] Under Ashoka , the Maurya Empire of Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia , including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan in the 3rd century BCE. [ 16 ] From the 3rd to the 6th centuries CE, the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire . Later rulers Two kingdoms – Vanga or Samatata and Gauda – are mentioned in some texts to have appeared after the end of Gupta Empire, although details of their ruling time are uncertain. [ 17 ] The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka who reigned in the early 7th century. [ 18 ] Shashanka is often recorded in Buddhist annals as an intolerant ruler who is noted for his persecution of the Buddhists. Shashanka murdered Rajyavardhana, the Buddhist King of Thanesar, and is noted for destroying the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya , and replacing Buddha statues with Shiva Lingams. [ 19 ] After a period of anarchy, [ 20 ] :36 the Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years starting from the eighth century, followed by a shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty . Some areas of Bengal were invaded by Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty between 1021 and 1023. [ 21 ] Islam made its first appearance in Bengal during the 12th century when Sufi missionaries arrived. [ 22 ] Later, occasional Muslim raiders reinforced the process of conversion by building mosques , madrasas and khanqahs . Between 1202 and 1206, Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji , a military commander from the Delhi Sultanate , overran Bihar and Bengal as far east as Rangpur , Bogra and the Brahmaputra River . Although he failed to bring Bengal under his control, the expedition managed to defeat Lakshman Sen and his two sons moved to a place then called Vikramapur (present-day Munshiganj District ), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century. Ram Mohan Roy is regarded as the "Father of the Bengali renaissance ". Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region. [ 23 ] Consequently, the region was ruled by dynasties of Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years. Smaller Hindu states, landlords and Baro-Bhuyans also ruled in parts of Bengal. The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for 20 years by an uprising by the Hindus under Raja Ganesha . In the sixteenth century, Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal. However, administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence of the area under the Nawabs of Murshidabad , who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi . There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the Mughal period like those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman . The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals and survived till the advent of the British. Colonial era Several European traders arrived late in the fifteenth century. Their influence grew until the British East India Company gained taxation rights in Bengal subah (province) following the Battle of Plassey in 1757, when Siraj ud-Daulah , the last independent Nawab , was defeated by the British. [ 24 ] The Bengal Presidency of the British Empire was established by 1765, eventually including all British territories north of the Central Provinces (now Madhya Pradesh ), from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab . The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives. [ 25 ] Calcutta was named the capital of British India in 1772. The Bengal Renaissance and Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements had great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal. The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in transfer of authority to the British Crown , administered by the Viceroy of India . [ 26 ] Between 1905 and 1911, an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones. [ 27 ] Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943 that claimed 3 million lives. [ 28 ] The Indian independence movement Subhas Chandra Bose was a independence activist in the Indian independence movement against the British Raj . Bengal played a major role in the Indian independence movement , in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army from Southeast Asia against the British. After independence When India gained independence in 1947, Bengal was partitioned along religious lines. The western part went to Dominion of India (and was named West Bengal) while the eastern part went to Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal (later renamed as East Pakistan in 1956), which gave rise to independent Bangladesh in 1971. [ 29 ] In 1950, the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal. [ 30 ] In 1955, the former French enclave of Chandannagar , which had passed into Indian control after 1950, was integrated into West Bengal; portions of Bihar were subsequently merged with West Bengal. Both West and East Bengal suffered from large refugee influx during and after the partition in 1947. Refugee settlement and related issues continued to play significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state. [ 31 ] During the 1970s and 1980s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Naxalite movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure. [ 32 ] The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands. West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress . The Left Front, led by Communist Party of India (Marxist) , governed the state for the subsequent three decades. [ 33 ] Recent history The state's economic recovery gathered momentum after economic liberalisations were introduced in the mid-1990s by the central government , aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services . Since mid-2000s, armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state, [ 34 ] [ 35 ] while clashes with the administration took place at several sensitive places over the issue of industrial land acquisition, [ 36 ] [ 37 ] which became a crucial reason behind the defeat of ruling Left Front government in 2011 assembly election. [ 38 ] Although the state's GDP has risen significantly since the 1990s, West Bengal has remained affected by political instability and bad governance. [ 39 ] The state continues to suffer from regular bandhs ( strikes ), [ 40 ] [ 41 ] a low Human Development Index level, [ 42 ] substandard healthcare services, [ 43 ] [ 44 ] a lack of socio-economic development, [ 45 ] poor infrastructure, [ 46 ] [ 47 ] political corruption and civil violence. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Geography and climate Main articles: Geography of West Bengal and Climate of West Bengal Many areas remain flooded during the heavy rains brought by monsoon National Highway 31A winds along the banks of the Teesta River near Kalimpong , in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region. West Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India, stretching from the Himalayas in the north, to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The state has a total area of 88,752 square kilometres (34,267 sq mi). [ 1 ] The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state belongs to the eastern Himalaya . This region contains Sandakfu (3,636 m or 11,929 ft)—the highest peak of the state. [ 50 ] The narrow Terai region separates this region from the North Bengal plains , which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south. The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands . A small coastal region is on the extreme south, while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta . The Ganges is the main river, which divides in West Bengal. One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma or Pôdda , while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River . The Farakka barrage over Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a feeder canal, and its water flow management has been a source of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh. [ 51 ] The Teesta , Torsa , Jaldhaka and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region. The western plateau region has rivers such as the Damodar , Ajay and Kangsabati . The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks. Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem. [ 52 ] Damodar , another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the "Sorrow of Bengal" (due to its frequent floods), has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project . At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater , and an estimated 8.7 million people drink water containing arsenic above the World Health Organisation recommended limit of 10 µg /L. [ 53 ] West Bengal's climate varies from tropical savanna in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north. The main seasons are summer, rainy season, a short autumn, and winter. While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity, the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India, with the highest day temperature ranging from 38 °C (100 °F) to 45 °C (113 °F). [ 54 ] At nights, a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal. In early summer brief squalls and thunderstorms known as Kalbaisakhi , or Nor'westers, often occur. [ 55 ] West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian ocean monsoon that moves in a northwest direction. Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September. Heavy rainfall of above 250 cm is observed in the Darjeeling , Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar district . During the arrival of the monsoons, low pressure in the Bay of Bengal region often leads to the occurrence of storms in the coastal areas . Winter (December–January) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of 15 °C (59 °F). [ 54 ] A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter, substantially lowering the humidity level. The Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter, with occasional snowfall at places. Flora and fauna A Bengal tiger . Sal trees in the Arabari forest in West Midnapur . As of 2013, recorded forest area in the state is 16,805 km 2 (6,488 sq mi) which is 18.93% of the state's geographical area, compared to the national average of 21.23%. [ 56 ] Reserves, protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4%, 31.8% and 8.9%, respectively, of the forest area, as of 2009. [ 57 ] Part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans , is located in southern West Bengal. [ 58 ] State symbols of West Bengal State animal Fishing cat [ 59 ] State bird White-throated kingfisher State tree Devil tree [ 59 ] State flower Night-flowering jasmine [ 59 ] From a phytogeographic viewpoint, the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. [ 60 ] The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain, compounded with favourable rainfall, make this region especially fertile. [ 60 ] Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state shares floristic similarities with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand. [ 60 ] The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta , commonly known as the Sal tree . The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation; the predominant tree is the Casuarina . A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari ( Heritiera fomes ), from which the forest gets its name. [ 61 ] The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation . For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the Dooars , are densely wooded with Sal and other tropical evergreen trees. [ 62 ] However, above an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft), the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above 1,500 metres (4,900 ft), temperate-forest trees such as oaks , conifers , and rhododendrons predominate. [ 62 ] West Bengal has 3.26% of its geographical area under protected areas comprising 15 wildlife sanctuaries and 5 national parks [ 57 ] — Sundarbans National Park , Buxa Tiger Reserve , Gorumara National Park , Neora Valley National Park and Singalila National Park . Extant wildlife include Indian rhinoceros , Indian elephant , deer, leopard , gaur , tiger, and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. [ 63 ] The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer , red panda , chinkara , takin , serow , pangolin , minivet and kalij pheasants . The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the endangered Bengal tiger , although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin , river terrapin and estuarine crocodile . [ 64 ] The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. [ 64 ] Recognising its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve . [ 57 ] Government and politics Main articles: Government of West Bengal and Politics of West Bengal See also: Council of Ministers of West Bengal and List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal Calcutta High Court is the highest court in West Bengal Raj Bhavan, the residence of the Governor of the state West Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy , a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. There are two branches of government. The legislature, the West Bengal Legislative Assembly , consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister , although the titular head of government is the Governor . The Governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India . The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 295 Members of the Legislative Assembly , or MLAs, [ 65 ] including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community. Terms of office run for 5 years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats , for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha [ 66 ] and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament . [ 67 ] The main players in the regional politics are the All India Trinamool Congress , the Indian National Congress , and the Left Front alliance (led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M)). Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011 , the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power (getting 225 seats in the legislature). [ 68 ] Prior to this, West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years (1977–2011), making it the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government.

[ 71 ] Each district is subdivided into Sub-Divisions, governed by a sub-divisional magistrate , and again into Blocks. Blocks consists of panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities. [ 70 ] The capital and largest city of the state is Kolkata – the third-largest urban agglomeration [ 72 ] and the seventh-largest city [ 73 ] in India. Asansol is the second largest city & urban agglomeration in West Bengal after Kolkata. [ 72 ] Siliguri is an economically important city, strategically located in the northeastern Siliguri Corridor (Chicken's Neck) of India. Other major cities and towns in West Bengal are Howrah , Durgapur , Baharampur , Raniganj , Haldia , Jalpaiguri , Kharagpur , Burdwan , Darjeeling , Midnapore , and Malda . [ 73 ] Economy Main article: Economy of West Bengal Roadside vegetable vendor in a semi-rural area. A large proportion of residents are employed in informal occupations.

[ 74 ] :12 Agriculture is the leading occupation in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute , sugarcane and wheat are the top five crops of the state. [ 74 ] :14 Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. [ 74 ] :14 State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and Haldia port region. [ 75 ] The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. [ 75 ] Manufacturing industries playing an important economic role are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals and fertilisers . Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries. Years after independence, West Bengal was still dependent on the central government for meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, there has been a significant spurt in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. [ 76 ] The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–81, declining to 5% by 1997–98. However, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate. [ 76 ] Freshly sown saplings of paddy ; in the background are stacks of jute sticks In terms net state domestic product (NSDP), West Bengal has the sixth largest economy (2009–2010) in India, with an NSDP of 3663 billion Indian rupees , behind Maharashtra (8179 billion), Uttar Pradesh (4530 billion), Andhra Pradesh (4268 billion), Tamil Nadu (4177 billion), and Gujarat (3704 billion). [ 3 ] In the period 2004–2005 to 2009–2010, the average gross state domestic product (GSDP) growth rate was 13.9% (calculated in Indian rupee term), lower than 15.5%, the average for all states of the country. [ 74 ] :4 The state’s per capita GSDP at current prices in 2009–10 was US$956.4, improved from US$553.7 in 2004–05, [ 74 ] :10 but lower than the national per capita GSDP of US$1,302. [ 74 ] :4 The state's total financial debt stood at ₹ 1918350 million (US$28 billion) as of 2011. [ 77 ] The state has promoted foreign direct investment , which has mostly come in the software and electronics fields; Kolkata is becoming a major hub for the Information technology (IT) industry. Rapid industrialisation process has given rise to debate over land acquisition for industry in this agrarian state. [ 78 ] NASSCOM – Gartner ranks West Bengal power infrastructure the best in the country. [ 79 ] Notably, many corporate companies are now headquartered in Kolkata include ITC Limited , India Government Mint, Kolkata , Haldia Petrochemicals , Exide Industries , Hindustan Motors , Britannia Industries , Bata India , Birla Corporation , CESC Limited , Coal India Limited , Damodar Valley Corporation , PwC India, Peerless Group , United Bank of India , UCO Bank and Allahabad Bank . In 2010s, events such as adoption of "Look East" policy by the government of India, opening of the Nathu La Pass in Sikkim as a border trade-route with China and immense interest in the South East Asian countries to enter the Indian market and invest have put Kolkata in an advantageous position for development in future, particularly with likes of Myanmar, where India needs oil from military regime. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Transport See also: List of airports in West Bengal Kolkata Suburban Railway caters to the commuters of the populous suburbs of Kolkata Kolkata metro railway, the oldest metro in India , is the 17th Zone of Indian Railways . Durgapur Expressway As of 2011, the total length of surface road in West Bengal is over 92,023 km (57,180 mi); [ 74 ] :18 national highways comprise 2,578 km (1,602 mi) [ 82 ] and state highways 2,393 km (1,487 mi). [ 74 ] :18 As of 2006, the road density of the state is 103.69 km per 100 km 2 (166.92 mi per 100 sq mi), higher than the national average of 74.7 km per 100 km 2 (120 mi per 100 sq mi). [ 83 ] Average speed on state highways varies between 40–50 km/h (25–31 mi/h); in villages and towns, speeds are as low as 20–25 km/h (12–16 mi/h) due to the substandard quality of road constructions and low maintenance.
