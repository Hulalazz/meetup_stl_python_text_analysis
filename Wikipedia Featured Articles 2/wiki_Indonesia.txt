[ 7 ] Indonesia ( i / ˌ ɪ n d ə ˈ n iː ʒ ə / IN -də- NEE -zhə or / ˌ ɪ n d oʊ ˈ n iː z i ə / IN -doh- NEE -zee-ə ; Indonesian : [ɪndonesia] ), officially the Republic of Indonesia (Indonesian: Republik Indonesia [rɛpublik ɪndonesia] ), is a sovereign island country in Southeast Asia and Oceania . It is the largest island country in the world by the number of islands, with more than fourteen thousand islands . [ 8 ] Indonesia has an estimated population of over 255 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country . The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. Indonesia's republican form of government includes an elected legislature and president. Indonesia has 34 provinces , of which five have Special Administrative status. Its capital city is Jakarta . The country shares land borders with Papua New Guinea , East Timor , and the Malaysian Borneo . Other neighbouring countries include Singapore , the Philippines , Australia , Palau , and the Indian territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands . Indonesia is a founding member of ASEAN and a member of the G-20 major economies . The Indonesian economy is the world's 16th largest by nominal GDP and the 8th largest by GDP at PPP . The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when Srivijaya and then later Majapahit traded with China and India . Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early centuries CE , and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished. Indonesian history has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. Muslim traders and Sufi scholars brought the now-dominant Islam , [ 9 ] [ 10 ] while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery . Following three and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism starting from the East Indonesia of West Papua , Timor to eventually all of West Indonesia, at times interrupted by Portuguese , French and British rule, Indonesia secured its independence after World War II . Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, mass slaughter , corruption , separatism , a democratisation process , and periods of rapid economic change. Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native ethnic and linguistic groups . The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the Javanese . A shared identity has developed, defined by a national language , ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. Indonesia's national motto, "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" ("Unity in Diversity" literally, "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's second highest level of biodiversity . The country has abundant natural resources, yet poverty remains widespread.

[ 13 ] The name dates to the 18th century, far predating the formation of independent Indonesia. [ 14 ] In 1850, George Windsor Earl , an English ethnologist , proposed the terms Indunesians —and, his preference, Malayunesians —for the inhabitants of the "Indian Archipelago or Malayan Archipelago". [ 15 ] In the same publication, a student of Earl's, James Richardson Logan , used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] However, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia . Instead, they used the terms Malay Archipelago ( Maleische Archipel ); the Netherlands East Indies ( Nederlandsch Oost Indië ), popularly Indië ; the East ( de Oost ); and Insulinde . [ 18 ] After 1900, the name Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and Indonesian nationalist groups adopted it for political expression. [ 18 ] Adolf Bastian , of the University of Berlin, popularised the name through his book Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894 . The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was Suwardi Suryaningrat (Ki Hajar Dewantara), when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name Indonesisch Pers-bureau in 1913. [ 14 ] History Main article: History of Indonesia A Borobudur ship carved on Borobudur , c. 800 CE. Indonesian outrigger boats may have made trade voyages to the east coast of Africa as early as the 1st century CE. [ 19 ] Fossils and the remains of tools show that the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by Homo erectus , popularly known as " Java Man ", between 1.5 million years ago and 35,000 years ago. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Homo sapiens reached the region by around 45,000 years ago. [ 23 ] Austronesian peoples , who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from Taiwan. They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE, and as they spread through the archipelago, confined the indigenous Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions. [ 24 ] Ideal agricultural conditions, and the mastering of wet-field rice cultivation as early as the 8th century BCE, [ 25 ] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to flourish by the 1st century CE. Indonesia's strategic sea-lane position fostered inter-island and international trade, including links with Indian kingdoms and China, which were established several centuries BCE. [ 26 ] Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] From the 7th century CE, the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade and the influences of Hinduism and Buddhism that were imported with it. [ 29 ] Between the eighth and 10th centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan . The Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under Gajah Mada , its influence stretched over much of Indonesia. [ 30 ] Although Muslim traders first traveled through Southeast Asia early in the Islamic era, the earliest evidence of Islamized populations in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra . [ 31 ] Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java. [ 32 ] The first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of Indonesia began in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão , sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg, cloves , and cubeb pepper in Maluku. [ 33 ] Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant European power. Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalized colony. [ 34 ] The nutmeg plant is native to Indonesia's Banda Islands . Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies as a nationalised colony. [ 35 ] For most of the colonial period , Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous outside of coastal strongholds; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries. [ 36 ] Despite major internal political, social and sectarian divisions during the National Revolution , Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence. Japanese occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule, [ 37 ] and encouraged the previously suppressed Indonesian independence movement. [ 38 ] A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia as a result of famine and forced labor during the Japanese occupation. [ 39 ] Two days after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, Sukarno , an influential nationalist leader, declared independence and was appointed president. [ 40 ] The Netherlands tried to reestablish their rule, and an armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949, when in the face of international pressure, the Dutch formally recognized Indonesian independence [ 41 ] (with the exception of the Dutch territory of West New Guinea , which was incorporated into Indonesia following the 1962 New York Agreement , and the UN-mandated Act of Free Choice of 1969). [ 42 ] Sukarno , the founding father and first President of Indonesia . Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism, and maintained his power base by balancing the opposing forces of the military and the PKI. [ 43 ] An attempted coup on 30 September 1965 was countered by the army, who led a violent anti-communist purge , during which the PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Hundreds of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The head of the military, General Suharto , outmaneuvered the politically weakened Sukarno and was formally appointed president in March 1968. His New Order administration [ 49 ] was supported by the US government, [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] and encouraged foreign direct investment in Indonesia, which was a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth. However, the authoritarian "New Order" was widely accused of corruption and suppression of political opposition. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the late 1990s Asian financial crisis . [ 56 ] This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protest across the country. Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998. [ 57 ] In 1999, East Timor voted to secede from Indonesia, after a twenty-five-year military occupation that was marked by international condemnation of repression of the East Timorese. [ 58 ] Since Suharto's resignation, a strengthening of democratic processes has included a regional autonomy program, and the first direct presidential election in 2004 , which was won by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , who went on to win a second term in 2009 . Political and economic instability, social unrest, corruption , and terrorism slowed progress; however, in the last five years the economy has performed strongly. Although relations among different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, sectarian discontent and violence have persisted. [ 59 ] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005. [ 60 ] Joko Widodo was elected as President in the 2014 presidential election . Government and politics Main articles: Politics of Indonesia and Elections in Indonesia A session of the People's Representative Council in Jakarta Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system. As a unitary state, power is concentrated in the central government. Following the resignation of President Suharto in 1998, Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms. Four amendments to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia [ 61 ] have revamped the executive , judicial , and legislative branches. [ 62 ] The president of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government , commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces , and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature. The 2004 presidential election was the first in which the people directly elected the president and vice-president. [ 63 ] The president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms. [ 64 ] The highest representative body at national level is Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat ( People's Consultative Assembly ) or MPR. Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating the president, and formalising broad outlines of state policy. It has the power to impeach the president. [ 65 ] The MPR comprises two houses; Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat ( People's Representative Council ) or DPR, with 560 members, and Dewan Perwakilan Daerah ( Regional Representative Council ) or DPD, with 132 members. [ 66 ] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch; party-aligned members are elected for five-year terms by proportional representation . [ 62 ] Reforms since 1998 have markedly increased the DPR's role in national governance. [ 67 ] The DPD is a new chamber for matters of regional management. [ 68 ] Most civil disputes appear before Pengadilan Negeri (State Court); appeals are heard before Pengadilan Tinggi (High Court). Mahkamah Agung is the country's highest court, and hears final cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the Commercial Court, which handles bankruptcy and insolvency; Pengadilan Tata Negara (State Administrative Court) to hear administrative law cases against the government; Mahkamah Konstitusi (Constitutional Court) to hear disputes concerning legality of law, general elections, dissolution of political parties, and the scope of authority of state institutions; and Pengadilan Agama (Religious Court) to deal with codified Sharia Law cases. [ 69 ] Foreign relations and military Main articles: Foreign relations of Indonesia and Indonesian National Armed Forces Former President of Indonesia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with US President Barack Obama , in ceremony at the Istana Merdeka in Jakarta, 9 November 2010. Obama has become popular in Indonesia due to the years he spent in Jakarta as a child. [ 70 ] In contrast to Sukarno's anti-imperialistic antipathy to Western powers and tensions with Malaysia , Indonesia's foreign relations since the New Order era have been based on economic and political co-operation with the Western world. [ 71 ] Indonesia maintains close relationships with its neighbours in Asia, and is a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit . [ 66 ] The country restored relations with the People's Republic of China in 1990 following a freeze in place since anti-communist purges early in the Suharto era. [ 69 ] Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950, [ 72 ] and was a founder of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). [ 66 ] Indonesia is signatory to the ASEAN Free Trade Area agreement, the Cairns Group , and the World Trade Organization (WTO), and a member of OPEC . Indonesia has received humanitarian and development aid since 1966, in particular from the United States, western Europe, Australia, and Japan. [ 66 ] The Indonesian government has worked with other countries to apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of major bombings linked to militant Islamism and Al-Qaeda . [ 73 ] The deadliest bombing killed 202 people (including 164 international tourists) in the Bali resort town of Kuta in 2002. [ 74 ] The attacks, and subsequent travel warnings issued by other countries, severely damaged Indonesia's tourism industry and foreign investment prospects. [ 75 ] Indonesian Naval vessels Indonesia's armed forces (TNI) include the army (TNI–AD), navy (TNI–AL, which includes marines), and air force (TNI–AU). [ 76 ] The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defense spending in the national budget was 4% of GDP in 2006, and is controversially supplemented by revenue from military commercial interests and foundations. [ 77 ] One of the reforms following the 1998 resignation of Suharto was the removal of formal TNI representation in parliament; nevertheless, its political influence remains extensive. [ 78 ] Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict, and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] Following a sporadic thirty-year guerrilla war between the Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) and the Indonesian military, a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. [ 81 ] In Papua, there has been a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws, and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses , since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. [ 82 ] Administrative divisions Main articles: Provinces of Indonesia and Subdivisions of Indonesia Monas as a landmark of capital of Indonesia, Jakarta Administratively, Indonesia consists of 34 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own legislature and governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies ( kabupaten ) and cities ( kota ), which are further subdivided into districts ( kecamatan or distrik in Papua and West Papua), and again into administrative villages (either desa , kelurahan , kampung , nagari in West Sumatra, or gampong in Aceh). Village is the lowest level of government administration in Indonesia. Furthermore, a village is divided into several community groups ( rukun warga (RW)) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups ( rukun tetangga (RT)). In Java the desa (village) is divided further into smaller units called dusun or dukuh (hamlets), these units are the same as rukun warga. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected lurah or kepala desa (village chief). The provinces of Aceh , Jakarta , Yogyakarta , Papua , and West Papua have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces. The Acehnese government, for example, has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system; in 2003, it instituted a form of sharia (Islamic law). [ 83 ] Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution and its willingness to join Indonesia as a republic. [ 84 ] Papua, formerly known as Irian Jaya, was granted special autonomy status in 2001 and was split into Papua and West Papua in February 2003. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Jakarta is the country's special capital region.

Indonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N , and longitudes 95°E and 141°E . It consists of 17,508 islands, about 6,000 of which are inhabited. [ 87 ] These are scattered over both sides of the equator . The largest are Java, Sumatra, Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), New Guinea (shared with Papua New Guinea), and Sulawesi. Indonesia shares land borders with Malaysia on Borneo, Papua New Guinea on the island of New Guinea, and East Timor on the island of Timor . Indonesia shares maritime borders across narrow straits with Singapore , Malaysia , the Philippines , and Palau to the north, and with Australia to the south. The capital, Jakarta, is on Java and is the nation's largest city, followed by Surabaya, Bandung, Medan, and Semarang. [ 88 ] At 1,919,440 square kilometres (741,050 sq mi), Indonesia is the world's 15th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. [ 89 ] Its average population density is 134 people per square kilometre (347 per sq mi), 79th in the world, [ 90 ] although Java, the world's most populous island, [ 91 ] has a population density of 940 people per square kilometre (2,435 per sq mi). At 4,884 metres (16,024 ft), Puncak Jaya in Papua is Indonesia's highest peak, and Lake Toba in Sumatra its largest lake, with an area of 1,145 square kilometres (442 sq mi). The country's largest rivers are in Kalimantan, and include the Mahakam and Barito ; such rivers are communication and transport links between the island's river settlements. [ 92 ] Paddy fields in Bali with Mount Agung in the background. Indonesia's location on the edges of the Pacific , Eurasian , and Australian tectonic plates makes it the site of numerous volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. Indonesia has at least 150 active volcanoes, [ 93 ] including Krakatoa and Tambora , both famous for their devastating eruptions in the 19th century. The eruption of the Toba supervolcano , approximately 70,000 years ago, was one of the largest eruptions ever, and a global catastrophe . Recent disasters due to seismic activity include the 2004 tsunami that killed an estimated 167,736 in northern Sumatra, [ 94 ] and the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006. However, volcanic ash is a major contributor to the high agricultural fertility that has historically sustained the high population densities of Java and Bali. [ 95 ] Lying along the equator, Indonesia has a tropical climate , with two distinct monsoonal wet and dry seasons. Average annual rainfall in the lowlands varies from 1,780–3,175 millimetres (70.1–125.0 inches), and up to 6,100 millimetres (240 inches) in mountainous regions. Mountainous areas – particularly in the west coast of Sumatra, West Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua – receive the highest rainfall. Humidity is generally high, averaging about 80%. Temperatures vary little throughout the year; the average daily temperature range of Jakarta is 26–30 °C (79–86 °F). [ 96 ] Biodiversity Main articles: Fauna of Indonesia and Flora of Indonesia The Komodo dragon , the largest lizard in the world, is endemic to a small number of Indonesian islands. Indonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography, support the world's second highest level of biodiversity after Brazil. [ 97 ] Its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and Australasian species. [ 98 ] The islands of the Sunda Shelf (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to the Asian mainland, and have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the tiger , rhinoceros , orangutan , elephant , and leopard , were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Forests cover approximately 60% of the country. [ 99 ] In Sumatra and Kalimantan, these are predominantly of Asian species. However, the forests of the smaller, and more densely populated Java, have largely been removed for human habitation and agriculture. Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku – having been long separated from the continental landmasses—have developed their own unique flora and fauna. [ 100 ] Papua was part of the Australian landmass, and is home to a unique fauna and flora closely related to that of Australia, including over 600 bird species. [ 101 ] Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its 515 species of mammal being endemic. [ 102 ] Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline are surrounded by tropical seas that contribute to the country's high level of biodiversity. Indonesia has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems , including beaches , sand dunes , estuaries , mangroves , coral reefs , seagrass beds, coastal mudflats , tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems. [ 13 ] Indonesia is one of Coral Triangle countries with the world's greatest diversity of coral reef fish with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only. [ 103 ] The British naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace , described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian and Australasian species. [ 104 ] Known as the Wallace Line , it runs roughly north–south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep Lombok Strait , between Lombok and Bali. West of the line the flora and fauna are more Asian; moving east from Lombok, they are increasingly Australian. In his 1869 book, The Malay Archipelago , Wallace described numerous species unique to the area. [ 105 ] The region of islands between his line and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea . [ 104 ] Environment Main article: Environment of Indonesia Fires on Borneo and Sumatra , 2015. People use slash-and-burn deforestation to clear land for agriculture. Indonesia's high population and rapid industrialisation present serious environmental issues , which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance. [ 106 ] Issues include large-scale deforestation (much of it illegal ) and related wildfires causing heavy smog over parts of western Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; over-exploitation of marine resources; and environmental problems associated with rapid urbanisation and economic development , including air pollution, traffic congestion , garbage management, and reliable water and waste water services. [ 106 ] Deforestation and the destruction of peatlands make Indonesia the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. [ 107 ] Habitat destruction threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species, including 140 species of mammals identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened , and 15 identified as critically endangered, including the Bali starling , [ 108 ] Sumatran orangutan , [ 109 ] and Javan rhinoceros . [ 110 ] Much of Indonesia's deforestation is caused by forest clearing for the palm oil industry, which has cleared 18 million hectares of forest for palm oil expansion. Palm oil expansion requires land reallocation as well as changes to the local and natural ecosystems. Palm oil expansion can generate wealth for local communities, but it can also degrade ecosystems and cause social problems. [ 111 ] Economy Main article: Economy of Indonesia Jakarta , the capital of Indonesia and the country's largest commercial centre. Indonesia has a mixed economy in which both the private sector and government play significant roles. [ 112 ] The country is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and a member of the G-20 major economies . [ 113 ] Indonesia's estimated gross domestic product (nominal) , as of 2014, was US$887 billion while GDP in PPP terms is US$2.685 trillion. It is the sixteenth largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and is the eighth largest in terms of GDP (PPP) . As of 2014, per capita GDP in PPP was US$10,651 ( international dollars ) while Nominal per capita GDP was US$3,518. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] The debt ratio to the GDP is 26%. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] The industry sector is the economy's largest and accounts for 46.4% of GDP (2012), this is followed by services (38.6%) and agriculture (14.4%). However, since 2012, the service sector has employed more people than other sectors, accounting for 47.9% of the total labour force, this has been followed by agriculture (38.9%) and industry (13.2%). [ 119 ] Agriculture, however, had been the country's largest employer for centuries. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] According to WTO data, Indonesia was the 27th biggest exporting country in the world in 2010, moving up three places from the previous year. [ 122 ] Indonesia's main export markets (2009) are Japan (17.28%), Singapore (11.29%), the United States (10.81%), and China (7.62%). The major suppliers of imports to Indonesia are Singapore (24.96%), China (12.52%), and Japan (8.92%). In 2014, Indonesia ran a trade deficit with export revenues of US$176 billion and import expenditure of US$178.2 billion. [ 123 ] The country has extensive natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas, tin, copper, and gold. Indonesia's major imports include machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels, and foodstuffs, and the country's major export commodities include oil and gas, electrical appliances, plywood, rubber, and textiles. [ 87 ] In an attempt to boost the domestic mineral processing industry and encourage exports of higher value-added mineral products, the Indonesian government implemented a ban on exports of unprocessed mineral ores in 2014. [ 123 ] Palm oil production is important to the economy of Indonesia as the country is the world's biggest producer and consumer of the commodity, providing about half the world supply. [ 124 ] Oil palm plantations stretch across 6 million hectares (roughly twice the size of Belgium ). The country plans by 2015 to add 4 million additional hectares towards oil palm biofuel production. [ 125 ] As of 2012, Indonesia produces 35 percent of the world's certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO). [ 126 ] Indomie , one of Indonesia's global brand. Indonesia is the world's second largest producer and consumer of instant noodle after China. The tourism sector contributes to around US$10.1 billion of foreign exchange in 2013, and ranked as the 4th largest among goods and services export sectors. [ 127 ] Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, China and Japan are the top five source of visitors to Indonesia. In the 1960s, the economy deteriorated drastically as a result of political instability, a young and inexperienced government, and economic nationalism, which resulted in severe poverty and hunger. By the time of President Sukarno's downfall in the mid-1960s, the economy was in chaos with 1,000% annual inflation, shrinking export revenues, crumbling infrastructure, factories operating at minimal capacity, and negligible investment . After Sukarno's downfall, the New Order administration brought a degree of discipline to economic policy that quickly brought inflation down, stabilised the currency, rescheduled external debt , and attracted foreign aid and investment. (See Berkeley Mafia ). Indonesia is currently Southeast Asia's only member of OPEC, and the 1970s oil price raises provided an export revenue windfall that contributed to sustained high economic growth rates, averaging over 7% from 1968 to 1981. [ 128 ] Following further reforms in the late 1980s, [ 129 ] foreign investment flowed into Indonesia, particularly into the rapidly developing export-oriented manufacturing sector , and from 1989 to 1997, the Indonesian economy grew by an average of over 7%. [ 130 ] [ 131 ] Indonesia Stock Exchange building. Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the 1997 Asian financial crisis . During the crisis, there were sudden and large capital outflows leading the rupiah to go into free fall. Against the US dollar the rupiah dropped from about Rp 2,600 in late 1997 to a low point of around Rp 17,000 some months later and the economy shrank by a remarkable 13.7%. These developments led to widespread economic distress across the economy and contributed to the political crisis of 1998 which saw Suharto resign as president. [ 132 ] The rupiah later stabilised in the Rp. 8,000 range [ 133 ] and economic growth returned to 4% per year by 2000. [ 134 ] However, the currency still fluctuates, dropping below Rp 11,000 per dollar in September 2013. In addition, corruption has been a persistent problem. Transparency International, for example, has since ranked Indonesia below 100 in its Corruption Perceptions Index . [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Since 2007, however, with the improvement in banking sector and domestic consumption, national economic growth has accelerated to over 6% annually [ 137 ] [ 138 ] [ 139 ] and this helped the country weather the 2008–2009 Great Recession . [ 140 ] The Indonesian economy performed strongly during the financial crisis of 2007–08 and in 2012, its GDP grew by over 6%. [ 141 ] The country regained its investment grade rating in late 2011 after losing it in 1997.

[ 148 ] Transport Main article: Transport in Indonesia Pelni Shipping Routes 2006 Road transport is predominant, with a total system length of 437,759 km in 2008. Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well such as taxis . There are usually also bus services of various kinds such as the Kopaja buses and the more sophisticated TransJakarta bus rapid transit system in Jakarta. The TransJakarta is the largest bus rapid transit system in the world, boasts some 194 km and carriers more than 300,000 passengers daily. [ 149 ] In addition, BRT systems exist in Yogyakarta , Palembang , Bandung , Denpasar , Pekanbaru , Semarang , Makassar , and Padang without segregated lane. Many cities also have motorised auto rickshaws ( bajaj ) of various kinds. Cycle rickshaws , called becak in Indonesia, are a regular sight on city roads and provide inexpensive transportation. The rail transport system has four unconnected networks in Java and Sumatra primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic. The inter-city rail network on Java is complemented by local commuter rail services in the Jakarta metropolitan area ( KA Commuter Jabodetabek ), Surabaya , Medan , and Bandung . In Jakarta, suburban rail services carry 550,000 passengers a day. [ 150 ] In addition, mass rapid transit and light rail transit systems are under construction in Jakarta. Argo Bromo Anggrek, inter-city train serve Jakarta to Surabaya route Sea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. It is well developed, with each of the major islands having at least one significant port city . Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling archipelago , maritime shipping provides essential links between different parts of the country. Boats in common use include large container ships , a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorised vessels. Traditional wooden vessel pinisi still widely used as the inter-island freight service within Indonesian archipelago. Port of Tanjung Priok is Indonesia's busiest port, and the 21st busiest port in the world in 2013 , handling over 6.59 million TEUs. [ 151 ] To boost the port capacity, two-phase "New Tanjung Priok" extension project is currently ongoing. When fully operational in 2023, it will triple existing annual capacity. Frequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands, especially in the chain of islands stretching from Sumatra through Java to the Lesser Sunda Islands . On the busy crossings between Sumatra, Java, and Bali , multiple car ferries run frequently twenty-four hours per day. There are also international ferry services between across the Strait of Malacca between Sumatra and Malaysia , and between Singapore and nearby Indonesian islands, such as Batam . A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. The national shipping line, Pelni , provides passenger service to ports throughout the country on a two to four week schedule. These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands. Still smaller privately run boats provide service between islands. Soekarno–Hatta International Airport As of 2014, there were 237 airports in Indonesia, [ 152 ] including 17 international airports. Soekarno–Hatta International Airport is the 18th busiest airport in the world , serving 12,314,667 passengers, according to Airports Council International.

Bugis and Makassar people in Indonesia are also well-known with their technology in making wooden sailing vessel called pinisi boat . [ 159 ] The CASA/IPTN CN-235 In aerospace technology, Indonesia has a long history in developing military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in Southeast Asia to produce and develop its own aircraft, also producing aircraft components for Boeing and Airbus , with its state-owned aircraft company (founded in 1976), the Indonesian Aerospace ( Indonesian : PT. Dirgantara Indonesia ), which, with EADS CASA of Spain developed the CN-235 aircraft, which has been exported to many countries. B. J. Habibie , a former Indonesian president played an important role in this achievement. While active as a professor in Germany, Habibie conducted many research assignments, producing theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics, known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method respectively. [ 160 ] Indonesia also hopes to manufacture the South Korean KAI KF-X fighter. [ 161 ] Furthermore, Indonesia has a well established railway industry, with its state-owned train manufacturer company, the Indonesian Railway Industry ( Indonesian : PT. Industri Kereta Api ), located in Madiun , East Java . Since 1982, the company has been producing passenger train wagons, freight wagons and other railway technologies and exported to many countries, such as Malaysia and Bangladesh . [ 162 ] In the 1980s an Indonesian engineer, Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented a road construction technique named Sosrobahu which becomes famous afterwards and widely used by many countries. The technology has been exported to the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore and in 1995, a patent was granted to Indonesia.

Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include: Dutch author Multatuli , who criticised treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule; Sumatrans Mohammad Yamin and Hamka , who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians; [ 240 ] and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer , Indonesia's most famous novelist. [ 241 ] [ 242 ] Pramoedya earned several accolades, and was frequently discussed as Indonesia's and Southeast Asia's best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature . [ 243 ] Indonesian literature and poetry flourished even more in the first half of the 20th century. Chairil Anwar was considered as the greatest literary figure of Indonesia by American poet and translator, Burton Raffel . [ 244 ] He was among those youngsters who pioneered in changing the traditional Indonesian literature and modifying it on the lines of the newly independent country. Some of his popular poems include Krawang-Bekasi , Diponegoro and Aku . Other major authors include Marah Roesli ( Sitti Nurbaya ), Merari Siregar ( Azab dan Sengsara ), Abdul Muis ( Salah Asuhan ), Djamaluddin Adinegoro ( Darah Muda ), Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana ( Layar Terkembang ), and Amir Hamzah ( Nyanyi Sunyi ) whose works are among the most well known in Maritime Southeast Asia . [ 245 ] Cuisine Main articles: Indonesian cuisine , List of Indonesian dishes and Alcohol in Indonesia Rendang . Indonesian dishes. Rendang served with steamed rice, cassava leaf, egg and gulai sauce, as well as Indonesian dishes, including ikan bakar , ayam goreng , nasi timbel , sambal , tempeh goreng , tahu , and sayur asem . Indonesian cuisine varies by region and is based on Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and Indian precedents. [ 246 ] Rice is the main staple food and is served with side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably chili), coconut milk , fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients. [ 247 ] Media Main article: Media of Indonesia Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President Suharto's rule, during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media, and restricted foreign media. [ 248 ] The TV market includes ten national commercial networks, and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI . Private radio stations carry their own news bulletins and foreign broadcasters supply programs. At a reported 25 million users in 2008, [ 249 ] Internet usage was estimated at 12.5% in September 2009. [ 250 ] More than 30 million cell phones are sold in Indonesia each year, and 27% of them are local brands.
